} | Response: {"answers":["Yes, the grace period for premium payment is 30 days. This allows the policy to be renewed or continued without losing continuity benefits related to waiting periods and pre-existing diseases. However, coverage is not available during the grace period if the premium is not received.","The waiting period for pre-existing diseases (PED) is generally 36 months. However, this exclusion shall not be applicable for claims arising due to an accident. Also, if any specified disease/procedure falls under the waiting period specified for Pre-Existing Diseases, then the longer of the two waiting periods shall apply.","Yes, the policy covers maternity expenses, including childbirth (complicated deliveries and caesarean sections) and lawful medical termination of pregnancy. However, there's a waiting period of 24 months, and the insured person should be between 18 and 45 years of age. The coverage amount is subject to the Table of Benefits, with specific limits for normal and caesarean deliveries.","Yes, there is a waiting period for cataract surgery. According to the document, cataract is listed under the \"Two years waiting period\" section. However, the document also mentions a limit for cataract surgery after continuous coverage, specifying \"Up to 15% of SI or INR 60,000 whichever is lower\".","No, the policy has specific exclusions related to organ transplants. These exclusions include pre- and post-hospitalization expenses of the organ donor, costs associated with acquiring the donor's organ, experimental transplants, complications for the donor, and expenses for organ transportation or preservation. However, medical expenses for the organ donor are covered if the donation confirms to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994, the organ is for an insured person, and the expenses are incurred as an in-patient in a hospital.","Yes, a No Claim Discount (NCD) of 5% is offered on the base premium upon renewal if no claims are reported during the expiring policy term. For policies exceeding one year, the NCD for each claim-free year is aggregated, but the total NCD cannot exceed 5% of the total base premium for the policy term.","Yes, health check-up expenses shall be reimbursed (irrespective of past claims) at the end of a block of two continuous policy years, provided the policy has been continuously renewed with the Company without a break. Expenses payable are subject to the limit stated in the Table of Benefits.","The policy defines a hospital as an establishment registered with local authorities under the Clinical Establishments Act, 2010, or complying with minimum criteria. It also mentions in-patient treatment and pre-hospitalization expenses that the company shall indemnify.","Yes, the company shall indemnify medical expenses incurred for inpatient care treatment under Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy systems of medicines during each Policy Period up to the limit of Sum Insured as specified in the Policy Schedule in any AYUSH Hospital. An AYUSH Hospital is a healthcare facility where medical treatments are carried out by AYUSH Medical Practitioners.","Yes, room charges and intensive care unit charges per day are payable up to the limit as shown in the Table of Benefits for Plan A. However, this limit does not apply if the treatment is undergone for a listed procedure in a Preferred Provider Network (PPN) as a package."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 85545.33 ms

} | Response: {"answers":["The grace period for premium payment is thirty days. This period immediately follows the premium due date, allowing policyholders to renew or continue their policy without losing continuity benefits related to waiting periods and pre-existing disease coverage. However, coverage is not available during the grace period if the premium is not received.","The policy excludes expenses related to the treatment of pre-existing diseases (PED) and their direct complications. The provided context does not specify a waiting period for PED coverage, only that they are initially excluded.","No, this policy does not cover maternity expenses. The provided context states that expenses incurred for maternity or infertility are specifically excluded from domiciliary hospitalization coverage.","Yes, the waiting period for cataract surgery is two years. This is listed under the \"Two years waiting period\" section in the provided document.","Yes, medical expenses incurred for the organ donor as an in-patient in a hospital are covered under this policy. The organ donation must also conform to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994 and its amendments, and the organ must be used for an insured person who has been medically advised to undergo a transplant.","Yes, the policy offers a No Claim Discount (NCD). On renewal of policies with a one-year term, a flat 5% NCD is allowed on the base premium, provided no claims were reported during the expiring policy. For policies exceeding one year, the NCD amount for each claim-free year is aggregated, but the total NCD cannot exceed 5% of the total base premium for the policy term.","Yes, health check-up expenses are reimbursed (irrespective of past claims) at the end of a block of two continuous policy years, provided the policy has been continuously renewed without a break. Expenses payable are subject to the limit stated in the Table of Benefits.","The provided context does not define \"Hospital\". However, it mentions portability norms for insured persons with continuous coverage, which is related to healthcare and potentially hospital stays.","AYUSH Treatment refers to medical and/or hospitalization treatments given in Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy systems.

} | Response: {"answers":["According to Newton, the quantity of motion is the measure of motion arising from the velocity and quantity of matter combined. The provided text defines force as a cause that alters the state of a body, while quantity of motion is a measure of the motion itself, based on velocity and mass. Thus, force is what *causes* changes in motion, while quantity of motion is a *description* of the motion.","The context mentions Newton's Third Law of Motion, stating that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. It also describes the law of gravitation, where bodies attract each other with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, which is used to explain the motions of celestial bodies. The context does not explicitly list all three laws of motion.","The provided context does not explicitly detail Newton's derivation of Kepler's Second Law. However, it mentions the relationship between force, time, and velocity, and refers to areas analogous to equal times and gravitating forces. This hints at the concepts used in the derivation, which involves showing that a central force (like gravity) results in a constant areal velocity, equivalent to Kepler's Second Law.","Yes, Newton demonstrates that the weight of two mutually gravitating spheres is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers, assuming uniform matter distribution around the centers. He also shows that a planet acted upon by an attractive force varying inversely as the square of the distance will describe an elliptical orbit.","Yes, Newton argues for universal gravitation based on observations and experiments showing that bodies near Earth gravitate towards it, the moon gravitates towards Earth, the sea towards the moon, planets mutually attract, and comets gravitate towards the sun. He concludes that all bodies possess a principle of mutual gravitation, proportional to their quantity of matter.","Newton explains that the perturbation of a planet's orbit is due to the excess of greater impulses acting upon some bodies and not acting upon others, changing their situation. The perturbation of Jupiter's orbit is less than Saturn's because the force disturbing Jupiter's motion is proportional to the difference in their masses. The Earth's orbit is also disturbed by the moon.","Yes, Newton used his \"fluxionary calculus\" in Principia, a precursor to modern calculus. However, the algorithm or notation for his fluxionary calculus didn't appear in Principia itself, but was published later in the second volume of Dr. Wallis's works in 1693.","Yes, Newton explains that a centripetal force, later identified as gravity, is necessary to constantly draw a celestial body towards a central point, preventing it from moving in a straight line and causing it to revolve in an orbit. Without this force, like the one retaining the moon in its orbit, the body would not stay in orbit.","Yes, Newton addresses motion in resisting media. He explains that projectiles moving through fluids experience resistance due to the pressure difference between the front and rear, and that the pressure from compression generates motion in the fluid, creating resistance. He also explores how the density and subtilty of the medium affect resistance, particularly at high speeds.","Newton believed in absolute space and time as immutable and independent entities, serving as the true reference frame for all motion. Relative motion, on the other hand, is defined with respect to other bodies and can be affected by forces without altering true motion, whereas absolute motion is a translation from one absolute place to another. This concept of absolute space and time provides a fixed backdrop against which Newton's laws of motion, particularly inertia, can be consistently applied.","Yes, according to the provided text, the grandfather of Sir Isaac Newton was Robert Newton. The text also mentions that the descent of Sir Isaac beyond his grandfather cannot be traced with certainty, but there were two family traditions about their origins.","No, beyond his grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac cannot with certainty be traced. There were two traditions in the family: one, that they were of Scotch extraction; the other, that they came originally from Newton, in Lancashire."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 160494.97 ms

} | Response: {"answers":["According to Newton, the quantity of motion is the measure of motion arising from the velocity and quantity of matter combined. The provided text defines forces as motive, accelerative, and absolute, relating to the endeavor of a body towards a center, the power diffused from the center, and the central force itself, respectively. Thus, quantity of motion is related to the object itself, while force is related to the interaction of objects.","The context mentions Newton's Third Law of Motion, stating that to every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction. It also discusses the law of gravitation, where bodies attract each other with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, which explains the motions of celestial bodies. The context does not explicitly state all three laws of motion.","The provided context does not explicitly detail Newton's derivation of Kepler's Second Law. However, Chunk 890 mentions \"equal times and equal gravitating forces\" being analogous to areas under a hyperbola, which relates to the concept of equal areas in equal times. The document also references Lemma VII and VIII, Book I, which are likely relevant to the derivation but are not included in the context.","Yes, Newton demonstrated that a planet acted upon by an attractive force varying inversely as the squares of the distances will describe an elliptical orbit, in one of whose foci the attractive force resides. He also stated that the weight of either sphere towards the other will be reciprocally as the square of the distance between their centres.","Yes, Newton argues that based on experiments and astronomical observations, bodies gravitate towards the Earth in proportion to their mass, and celestial bodies mutually gravitate towards each other. Therefore, he concludes that all bodies universally possess a principle of mutual gravitation. He also states that the argument for universal gravitation is stronger than that for impenetrability.","Newton explains that the perturbation of a planet's orbit is proportional to the difference in the disturbing force exerted by other planets. For example, the perturbation of Jupiter's orbit is less than Saturn's because the force disturbing Jupiter is smaller. He also notes the Earth's orbit is noticeably disturbed by the moon.","Yes, Newton's Principia presented the fundamental principle of his fluxionary calculus, a precursor to modern calculus, in the second Lemma of the second book. However, the algorithm or notation for his calculus did not appear in Principia; it was published later in the second volume of Dr. Wallis's works in 1693.","Yes, Newton explains that a centripetal force, later identified as gravity, constantly pulls celestial bodies towards a central point, preventing them from moving in a straight line. This force causes them to revolve in orbits, as seen with the moon being held in its orbit around the Earth.","Yes, Newton addresses motion in resisting media by considering the pressure exerted by the fluid on a projectile, which arises from the difference in pressure between the front and rear. He notes that this resistance is related to the motion generated in the fluid and is not significantly diminished by the subtilty of the medium at high speeds. Additionally, he explores the concept of an ethereal medium and investigates whether resistance is solely on the surface of bodies or also within their internal parts.","Newton believed in absolute space and time as immutable and independent entities, serving as the true reference frame for all motion. Relative motion, in contrast, is defined by the movement of objects relative to each other, which Newton considered a practical but not fundamental measure. This concept of absolute space and time provides a fixed backdrop against which his laws of motion could be universally applied.","Yes, according to the text, the grandfather of Sir Isaac Newton was Robert Newton. The text also mentions two traditions about the family's origins: one suggesting Scottish extraction and the other tracing them back to Newton in Lancashire.","No, beyond his grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac cannot with certainty be traced. There are two traditions: one, that they were of Scotch extraction; the other, that they came originally from Newton, in Lancashire."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 39394.99 ms

} | Response: {"answers":["The ideal spark plug gap is 0.8-0.9 mm. This measurement should be checked using a wire-type feeler gauge, and the side electrode should be carefully bent if adjustment is needed.","Yes, this vehicle uses tubeless tires. The rims are designed for tubeless tires, and using tube-type tires could cause rapid deflation during hard acceleration or braking. It is recommended to use the tire size and type specified in the owner's manual and visit an authorized Hero MotoCorp workshop for tire repairs or replacements.","No, it is not compulsory to have a disc brake. The vehicle specifications mention both \"Disc-Drum\" and \"Drum-Drum\" variants, indicating that a drum brake option is available. For the disc variant, it is important to maintain the brake fluid level between the brake pads, caliper, and disc, and to use DoT-4/DoT-3 brake fluid.","No, you cannot use Thums Up instead of engine oil. Engine oil is crucial for engine performance and longevity, and the document specifically recommends against using non-detergent, vegetable, or castor-based racing oils. Using Thums Up, which is a carbonated beverage, would cause serious engine damage.","The context does not contain information about generating Javascript code. Here's the code to generate a random number between 1 and 100: `Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;` This code uses `Math.random()` to generate a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), multiplies it by 100, takes the floor to get an integer between 0 and 99, and then adds 1 to get a number between 1 and 100."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 15973.64 ms

} | Response: {"answers":["Yes, the grace period for premium payment is thirty days. This grace period allows policyholders to renew or continue their policy without losing continuity benefits related to waiting periods and pre-existing diseases. However, coverage is not available during this grace period if the premium is not received.","Coverage for pre-existing diseases (PEDs) begins after a waiting period of 36 months, but only for PEDs declared in the Proposal Form and accepted by the Company. However, this exclusion shall not be applicable for claims arising due to an accident. There are also specific waiting periods for certain lifestyle conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac conditions (90 days) and other specific diseases/procedures (one year).","Yes, the policy covers maternity expenses, including medical treatment expenses traceable to childbirth (including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections) and lawful medical termination of pregnancy. However, there's a waiting period of 24 months, and the insured person should be between 18 and 45 years of age. The coverage also excludes maternity expenses of a surrogate mother unless the claim is admitted under the infertility section.","Yes, there is a waiting period for cataract surgery. According to the provided context, cataract is listed under \"iii. Two years waiting period.\" However, the context also mentions a limit for cataract surgery after continuous coverage, suggesting coverage after 36 months.","The medical expenses for an organ donor are covered under this policy if the organ donation confirms to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994, the organ is used for an insured person who has been medically advised to undergo a transplant, the expenses are incurred as an in-patient in a hospital, and the claim has been admitted under the In-patient Treatment Section. However, the policy excludes pre- and post-hospitalization expenses of the donor, costs associated with organ acquisition, experimental transplants, complications for the donor due to harvesting, and organ transportation or preservation expenses.","Yes, a No Claim Discount (NCD) of 5% is offered on the base premium upon renewal of policies with a one-year term, provided no claims were reported during the expiring policy. For policies exceeding one year, the NCD is aggregated for each claim-free year, but the total NCD cannot exceed 5% of the total base premium for the policy term.","Yes, health check-up expenses are reimbursed at the end of a block of two continuous policy years, irrespective of past claims, provided the policy has been continuously renewed without a break. Expenses payable are subject to the limit stated in the Table of Benefits.","The policy defines a hospital as an entity registered with local authorities under the Clinical Establishments Act, 2010, or equivalent enactments. Alternatively, it can be an entity that complies with all minimum criteria as defined in the policy.","Yes, the company shall indemnify medical expenses incurred for inpatient care under Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy systems of medicines during each policy period up to the limit of the sum insured as specified in the policy schedule in any AYUSH Hospital. An AYUSH Hospital is a healthcare facility where medical treatments are carried out by AYUSH Medical Practitioners.","Yes, for Plan A, room charges and intensive care unit charges per day are payable up to the limit shown in the Table of Benefits. However, this limit does not apply if the treatment is undergone for a listed procedure in a Preferred Provider Network (PPN) as a package."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 35622.74 ms

However, there is a waiting period of 24 months, and the insured person must be between 18 and 45 years of age. The policy may not cover maternity expenses for surrogate mothers unless the claim is admitted under the infertility section.","The waiting period for cataract surgery is two years, as it is listed under the \"Two years waiting period\" section. However, after continuous coverage, there is a limit for cataract surgery of up to 15% of the Sum Insured (SI) or INR 60,000, whichever is lower.","The medical expenses for an organ donor are covered under this policy if the organ donation confirms to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994, the organ is used for an insured person who has been medically advised to undergo a transplant, and the medical expenses are incurred for the organ donor as an in-patient in a hospital. However, the policy excludes pre- and post-hospitalization expenses of the organ donor, costs associated with the acquisition of the donor's organ, experimental transplants, complications for the donor due to harvesting, and organ transportation or preservation expenses.","Yes, a No Claim Discount (NCD) of 5% is allowed on the base premium for policies with a one-year term, provided no claims are reported. For policies exceeding one year, the NCD amount is aggregated for each claim-free year, but the total NCD cannot exceed 5% of the total base premium for the policy term.","I encountered an error while processing your question.

The provided text explicitly warns against installing a tube inside a tubeless tire and emphasizes the use of only tubeless tires due to the rim design, which could cause rapid deflation with tube-type tires during hard acceleration or braking.","The context indicates there are \"Disc-Drum\" and \"Drum-Drum\" variants for the vehicle, suggesting disc brakes are not compulsory. For the disc variant, it is recommended to clean the brake pads, caliper, and disc with a water jet and to use DoT-4/DoT-3 brake fluid. The brake fluid level should also be maintained above the \"MIN\" mark.","No, you cannot use Thums Up instead of engine oil. The context emphasizes the importance of using the recommended grade of engine oil for optimal engine performance and longevity, and cautions against using non-detergent, vegetable, or castor-based racing oils. Using Thums Up would likely cause severe engine damage.","Not relevant to the context.

} | Response: {"answers":["Yes, the grace period for premium payment is 30 days. This allows the policy to be renewed or continued without losing continuity benefits related to waiting periods and pre-existing diseases. Coverage is not available during the grace period if the premium is not received.","Pre-existing diseases (PEDs) are covered after a waiting period of 36 months. However, this applies only to PEDs declared in the proposal form and accepted for coverage by the company. There are also specific waiting periods for certain diseases/procedures, such as 90 days for hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac conditions.","Yes, the policy covers maternity expenses, including medical treatment expenses traceable to childbirth (including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections) and lawful medical termination of pregnancy. However, there are exclusions, such as treatment for covered female insured persons below eighteen (18) years and above forty-five (45) years of age, delivery or termination within a waiting period of twenty-four (24) months, more than one delivery or lawful medical termination of pregnancy during a single Policy Period, Maternity Expenses of Surrogate Mother, and Ectopic pregnancy.","Yes, there is a waiting period for cataract surgery. Based on the provided context, cataract is listed under \"iii. Two years waiting period\". However, the context also mentions a limit for cataract surgery being covered after 36 months and a limit for cataract surgery (for each eye per insured person) up to 15% of SI or INR 60,000 whichever is lower.","The medical expenses for an organ donor are covered under this policy if the organ donation confirms to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994, the organ is used for an insured person who has been medically advised to undergo a transplant, and the medical expenses are incurred for the donor as an in-patient in a hospital. However, the policy excludes pre- and post-hospitalization expenses of the organ donor, costs associated with the acquisition of the donor's organ, experimental transplants, complications for the donor due to harvesting, and expenses related to organ transportation or preservation.","Yes, a No Claim Discount (NCD) of 5% is offered on the base premium upon renewal of policies with a one-year term, provided no claims were reported during the expiring policy. For policies exceeding one year, the NCD is aggregated for each claim-free year, but the total NCD cannot exceed 5% of the total base premium for the policy term.","Yes, health check-up expenses shall be reimbursed (irrespective of past claims) at the end of a block of two continuous policy years, provided the Policy has been continuously renewed with the Company without a break. Expenses payable are subject to the limit stated in the Table of Benefits.","The policy defines a hospital as an entity registered with local authorities under the Clinical Establishments Act, 2010, or equivalent enactments. Alternatively, it can be an entity that complies with minimum criteria, though those criteria are not specified in this context.","Yes, the company shall indemnify medical expenses incurred for inpatient care treatment under Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy systems of medicines during each Policy Period up to the limit of Sum Insured as specified in the Policy Schedule in any AYUSH Hospital. An AYUSH Hospital is a healthcare facility where medical treatments are carried out by AYUSH Medical Practitioners.","Yes, room charges and intensive care unit charges per day are payable up to the limit shown in the Table of Benefits for Plan A only, as per Section 3.1.1.1. However, this limit does not apply if the treatment is undergone for a listed procedure in a Preferred Provider Network (PPN) as a package."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 28227.76 ms

} | Response: {"answers":["According to Newton, the quantity of motion is the measure of motion arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjointly. The provided context does not explicitly detail how \"quantity of motion\" is distinct from \"force,\" but it does define force as that which alters the state of a body, whether it be rest or uniform motion.","The context mentions Newton's Third Law of Motion, stating that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. It also discusses the laws of motion and gravitation being discovered through experimental philosophy and their application to celestial bodies. However, the context does not explicitly list all three laws of motion.","The provided context does not explicitly detail Newton's derivation of Kepler's Second Law. However, Chunk 890 mentions \"areas AB^K, K</rL, LrsM, MsJN, (fee., will be equal, and therefore analogous to the equal times and equal gravitating forces,\" which alludes to the concept of equal areas in equal times, a core component of Kepler's Second Law.","Yes, Newton demonstrates that the weight of two spheres mutually gravitating towards each other is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers, assuming uniform matter distribution. He also shows that a planet acted upon by an attractive force varying inversely as the square of the distance will describe an elliptical orbit.","Newton argues for universal gravitation based on observations and experiments showing that bodies near Earth gravitate towards it proportionally to their mass, the moon gravitates towards Earth, the sea towards the moon, planets mutually attract, and comets attract the sun. He concludes that all bodies possess a principle of mutual gravitation.","Newton explains that the perturbation of a planet's orbit is due to the excess of impulses acting upon some bodies and not others, changing their relative positions. He also notes that the perturbation of Jupiter's orbit is less than Saturn's, and that the Earth's orbit is noticeably disturbed by the moon.","Yes, Newton's *Principia* presented the fundamental principle of his fluxionary calculus in the second Lemma of the second book. However, its algorithm or notation did not appear until published in the second volume of Dr. Wallis's works in 1693, and Newton's notation for calculus was not standard at the time.","Newton explains that a centripetal force, later identified as gravity, is necessary to constantly draw a celestial body towards a central point, preventing it from moving in a straight line and causing it to revolve in an orbit. Without this force, like the one retaining the moon in its orbit, the body would not stay in orbit.","Newton explores the motion of fluids and the resistance encountered by projected bodies. He posits that projectiles moving through fluids generate motion due to pressure differences and that the resistance experienced by bodies in motion can be influenced by a subtle ethereal medium pervading all matter. He also notes that in elastic fluids, resistance is nearly equal for bodies moving at extreme speeds, regardless of the fluid's subtilty.","Newton defines absolute space and time as immutable and independent of any observer, serving as a fixed reference frame for all motion. Relative motion, on the other hand, is defined with respect to other bodies and is subject to change even when true motion remains unaltered. The context supports Newton's laws by establishing a foundation for defining motion and forces in a consistent and universal manner.","Yes, according to the text, the grandfather of Sir Isaac Newton was Robert Newton. The text also mentions two traditions about the family's origins: one suggesting Scottish extraction and the other tracing them back to Newton in Lancashire.","No, beyond Isaac Newton's grandfather, Robert Newton, his descent cannot be traced with certainty. There are two traditions: one suggesting Scottish extraction, and the other indicating origins in Newton, Lancashire, with a period in Westby, Lincolnshire, before settling in Woolsthorpe."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 32086.41 ms

Additionally, the expenses would not be covered if they are not considered a reasonable charge or a Medically Necessary Treatment, or if the drugs or treatments are not supported by a prescription.","Yes, the prosthetic device is payable as it is required in connection with the surgery. The walker and lumbar belt are generally not payable unless the lumbar belt was for a surgery of the lumbar spine.","No, the context focuses on orthodontic treatment for dependent children *below* 18, requiring pre-authorization with specific documentation. It does not address dental surgery eligibility or the process for dependents above 18 but under 26.","The cost of Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) is covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. ICU charges include expenses for the ICU bed, general medical support services, monitoring devices, critical care nursing, and intensivist charges. The context does not specify any limitations based on city population size.","Yes, a newly adopted child can be added as an insured person during the policy period if the application is accepted, the pro-rata premium is received, and an endorsement confirming the addition is issued. The provided context does not specify circumstances under which the insurer may refuse cover for the child, but general insurance principles allow refusal based on factors like fraud, misrepresentation, or policy terms.","The initial daycare cataract claim should be filed immediately after discharge for cashless, or within 15 days for reimbursement with required documents. The subsequent inpatient claim for complications, being for the same illness, follows the same process; payment is upfront in a non-network hospital, with reimbursement claim submission within 15 days of discharge, including claim form and relevant documents.","Yes, the newborn's treatment expenses are likely eligible for a claim, provided the mother is covered, maternity cover was opted for, and written notification was given within the specified timeframe. The policy covers medical treatment expenses traceable to childbirth, including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections, and newborn babies are accepted for cover from birth subject to the limitations of the New Born Baby Benefit Cover.","No, it is likely insufficient. While a discharge summary from a Clinical Psychologist is relevant, the context requires a prescription from an \"attending medical practitioner/surgeon\" for claim reimbursement, and for mental health treatment, the context specifies coverage for treatment by professionals with post-graduate degrees in specific fields like Ayurveda, Homoeopathy, Unani, or Siddha, in addition to Clinical Psychologists. A general practitioner's prescription alone may not meet these requirements.","ECG electrodes are payable up to 5 electrodes for each OT or ICU visit, with one set payable every second day for longer ICU stays. Sterilized gloves are payable, while unsterilized gloves are not.","Yes, both pre- and post-hospitalization expenses can be claimed. The policy covers pre-hospitalization medical expenses incurred 30 days before hospitalization and post-hospitalization medical expenses incurred for 60 days after discharge, provided they relate to the same illness for which inpatient hospitalization was claimed and accepted.","The context doesn't directly address what happens when a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period. However, it states that children above 18 are covered up to 26 if unmarried/unemployed and dependent. It also mentions that a dependent's coverage ends when they cease to be a dependent, unless otherwise agreed for continuation until the end of the policy period.","Reimbursement for medical expenses is proportionate to the ratio of the admissible room rate to the actual room rate. This applies when the room rate exceeds policy limits, but proportionate deductions are waived if the hospital doesn't follow differential billing based on room category. The relevant clause is the Proportionate Clause (Chunk 123).","Yes, the company must communicate the grounds for rejection within 15 days of receiving the final documents. If the claim remains rejected and is not subject to a pending suit within twelve months from the date of rejection, the claim is deemed abandoned. The insured can represent to the company for reconsideration within 15 days of receiving the claims decision.","Yes, the claim is likely eligible. The context defines \"Day Care Treatment\" as medical treatment or surgical procedures undertaken under anesthesia in a hospital/day care center in less than 24 hours due to technological advancement, which would have otherwise required hospitalization of more than 24 hours.","For towns with a population less than 10,00,000, the hospital must have at least 10 in-patient beds, qualified nursing staff round the clock, qualified medical practitioners in charge round the clock, a fully equipped operation theatre, and maintain daily patient records accessible to the insurance company. In all other places (metropolitan areas), the hospital must have at least 15 in-patient beds, while the other requirements remain the same.","Yes, a new employee and their spouse can be added mid-policy if the application is accepted, the pro-rata premium is paid, and an endorsement is issued. Siblings can be covered up to the age of 26 if they are unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. The context does not specify the required documentation.","The provided context discusses coverage for robotic surgeries for other diseases, not specifically cancer. Coverage for robotic surgeries, stereotactic radio surgeries, bronchial thermoplasty and vaporization of the prostate are up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. The context does not differentiate coverage or sub-limits based on whether the procedure is done as a day care procedure versus inpatient hospitalization.","The insured person must immediately notify the insurer for emergency evacuation, which requires pre-authorization. For air ambulance cover, an air ambulance ticket from a registered service provider is needed, and claims for pre and post-hospitalization are settled on a reimbursement basis with cash receipts and supporting documents.","Yes, if the insured person is continuously covered without any break as defined under the applicable norms on portability, then the waiting period for the specific illness would be reduced to the extent of prior coverage. However, waiting periods for listed conditions still apply even if contracted after the policy starts or were declared and accepted without a specific exclusion.","The provided context does not explicitly address coverage for imported medications not normally used in India. However, it mentions that expenses must be no more than what other hospitals or doctors in the same locality would charge for the same treatment. The policy also excludes treatments received in nature cure clinics, spas or similar establishments.","Yes, in the event of the death of a member, their dependents may continue to be covered until the expiry of the policy period at the option of the insured. The policy will end for a member if they die.","Original invoices with payment receipts and implant stickers are required for all implants used during surgeries. If only a generic invoice without the implant sticker is provided, the claim may be subject to further investigation, require additional documentation, or potentially be denied due to lack of supporting evidence.","Yes, home nursing charges may qualify for reimbursement if the medical expenses are for the same condition as the hospitalization, the inpatient hospitalization claim is admissible, and domiciliary hospitalization was medically required because the insured person could not be transferred to a hospital or a hospital bed was unavailable. The treating medical practitioner must confirm in writing the necessity of domiciliary hospitalization.","No, the primary insurer seeks details of other available policies and coordinates with other insurers to settle the balance amount as per policy conditions, provided the insured person submits a written request. If original documents were submitted to another insurer, certified copies and the claim settlement advice from that insurer may be accepted, subject to company satisfaction.","No, expenses related to admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded. Also, any diagnostic expenses which are not related or not incidental to the current diagnosis and treatment are excluded.","The context specifies that any change of nomination must be communicated to the Company in writing and is only effective when an endorsement on the policy is made. In the event of the policyholder's death, the company will pay the nominee named in the policy schedule/certificate/endorsement. If there is no subsisting nominee, payment is made to the legal heirs or representatives. Therefore, without a prior endorsement, a request to update the nominee after the demise of the previous nominee would not be valid.","Based on the provided context, prostheses or medical appliances are generally covered if required for surgery, immediately following surgery for medical necessity, or as part of short-term recuperation. However, the context does not explicitly list scenarios where they are NOT covered, so I cannot provide a definitive list of exclusions.","No, expenses will likely not be reimbursed. The context specifies that treatments received in establishments not registered with local authorities are typically excluded, and while AYUSH treatment is defined, the hospital must meet specific criteria, including registration, to be considered for coverage. Additionally, mental illness coverage may have specific limits as outlined in the policy schedule.","Yes, the network provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer or TPA if there is any change in the diagnosis, treatment plan, or cost of treatment during hospitalization. This process should follow the guidelines outlined in clause V.4.","No, the Pre-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim and Post- Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim shall be processed only after the decision of the main Hospitalisation claim. This means the main hospitalization claim must be assessed and approved before any pre- or post-hospitalization claims are considered.","The context does not directly provide the policyholder's contact details. However, in case of any grievance, the insured person may contact the company through Website: www.uiic.co.in, Toll free: 1800 425 333 33, E-mail: customercare@uiic.co.in, or Courier: Customer Care Department, Head Office, United India Insurance Co. Ltd., 24, Whites Road, Chennai, Tamil Nadu- 600014. The insured person may also approach the grievance cell at any of the Company's branches with the details of grievance.","No, automatically approving all claims is not possible. Claim settlement and rejection cannot be handled by a Third Party Administrator (TPA), and the company may request additional information for claim investigation. All claims are payable in Indian currency only.","Yes, if any claim is fraudulent, involves false statements or declarations, or uses fraudulent means, all benefits under the policy and the premium paid shall be forfeited. Additionally, any amounts already paid against fraudulent claims must be repaid to the insurer by the responsible parties. The insurer may also request additional documents for claim investigation.","Based on the provided context, it's unclear if you can receive reimbursement for expenses not related to hospitalization. The context mentions reimbursement for pre-hospitalization, hospitalization, and post-hospitalization expenses, but it also states that the company is not liable to reimburse medical expenses not specified in the policy. Please refer to your specific policy documents for details on covered expenses.","The insurance policy excludes several medical procedures, including treatments to change body characteristics to the opposite sex, cosmetic or plastic surgery (unless for reconstruction after an accident, burn, cancer, or medically necessary), treatments for external congenital anomalies, and circumcision unless medically necessary. It also excludes treatments that could be done on an outpatient basis, treatments not medically necessary, alternative treatments, and costs related to non-human organ transplants.","No, you cannot submit fraudulent claims successfully.

The context does not specify circumstances under which these expenses would *not* be covered if medically required.","Yes, the prosthetic device required for the hip replacement surgery is payable. The walker and lumbar belt used post-discharge are generally not payable unless the lumbar belt was for a lumbar spine surgery.","No, the context does not specify claim admissibility for dependent children above 18 but under 26. However, for dependent children below 18 requiring orthodontic treatment, pre-authorization is mandatory, and the process involves submitting a detailed treatment plan, X-rays, study models, and cost estimates from the dentist before treatment begins.","The cost of Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) is covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. ICU charges include expenses for the ICU bed, general medical support services, monitoring devices, critical care nursing, and intensivist charges. The context does not specify any additional limitations based on modern treatments or city population size.","Yes, a newly adopted child can be added as a dependent during the policy period if the application is accepted, the pro-rata premium is received, and an endorsement confirming the addition is issued. The provided context does not specify circumstances under which the insurer may refuse cover for the child, but generally, refusal could be based on factors like pre-existing conditions or policy limitations not detailed here.","The initial daycare cataract claim should be filed immediately after discharge for cashless, or within 15 days for reimbursement with required documents. If complications arise requiring inpatient care, a separate claim must be submitted for the second hospitalization, following the same timelines, and including all relevant documents for the new claim.","Yes, the newborn's treatment expenses are likely eligible for a claim, subject to the limitations of the New Born Baby Benefit Cover, provided the mother is covered and maternity cover was opted for. The policy accepts newborns for cover from birth if the mother is covered, with written notification required within a month of the birth, although the context does not specify whether the death of the newborn affects this eligibility.","No, it is likely insufficient. While a discharge summary from a Clinical Psychologist is relevant, the context suggests that claims may require certification from specific mental health professionals with post-graduate degrees in relevant fields like Ayurveda, Homoeopathy, Unani, or Siddha, in addition to Clinical Psychologists. The provided documentation also mentions the need for an attending medical practitioner's certificate regarding diagnosis supported by their prescription.","Yes, ECG electrodes are payable up to 5 electrodes for each OT or ICU visit, with one set payable every second day for longer ICU stays. Sterilized gloves are payable, while unsterilized gloves are not.","Yes, both pre- and post-hospitalization expenses can be claimed. The policy covers pre-hospitalization medical expenses incurred 30 days before hospitalization and post-hospitalization medical expenses incurred 60 days after discharge, provided they relate to the same illness for which inpatient hospitalization was claimed and approved.","The context doesn't explicitly state what happens when a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period. However, it does state that children above 18 are covered up to 26 years old if unmarried/unemployed and dependent. Therefore, coverage would likely terminate when the child turns 26, unless otherwise specified in the policy schedule.","Reimbursement for associated medical expenses is proportionate to how the admissible room rate relates to the actual room rate. This proportionate deduction does not apply if the hospital does not follow differential billing or if expenses are not differentially billed based on room category. The relevant clause is the Proportionate Clause (Chunk 123).","The company must communicate the grounds for rejection within 15 days of receiving the final documents. If the claim remains rejected and is not subject to a pending suit within twelve months from the date of rejection, it is deemed abandoned. The insured can represent to the company for reconsideration within 15 days of receiving the claim decision.","Yes, the claim is likely eligible. The context defines \"Day Care Treatment\" as medical treatment or surgical procedures undertaken under anesthesia in a hospital/day care center in less than 24 hours due to technological advancement, which would have otherwise required hospitalization of more than 24 hours.","For towns with a population less than 10,00,000, the hospital must have at least 10 in-patient beds, qualified nursing staff round the clock, qualified medical practitioners in charge, a fully equipped operation theatre, and maintain daily patient records accessible to the insurance company. In all other places (presumably metropolitan areas), the hospital must have at least 15 in-patient beds, with the other requirements remaining the same.","Yes, a new employee and their spouse can be added mid-policy if the application is accepted, the pro-rata premium is paid, and an endorsement is issued. Siblings can be covered up to the age of 26 if they are unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. The context does not specify the required documentation, but typically includes employee enrollment forms and proof of relationship for dependents.","The context mentions insurance coverage for Robotic Surgeries for other diseases, up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. However, it does not specify coverage details or sub-limits for robotic surgery specifically for cancer, nor does it differentiate between day care procedures and inpatient hospitalization. Therefore, the context does not provide enough information to answer the question.","Yes, the insured person must notify the insurer immediately either at their call center or in writing for emergency evacuation and repatriation, which shall be pre-authorized. For air ambulance cover, an air ambulance ticket for a registered service provider is required, and the claim will be processed as per the reimbursement process after the decision of the main hospitalization claim.","Yes, if the insured person has continuous coverage without any break, as defined under the portability norms, then the waiting period for a specific illness would be reduced to the extent of prior coverage. However, waiting periods for listed conditions still apply even if contracted after the policy starts or were declared and accepted without a specific exclusion.","The provided context does not explicitly address coverage for imported medications not normally used in India. However, it mentions that expenses must be no more than what other hospitals or doctors in the same locality would charge for the same treatment. The context also excludes treatments received in health hydros, nature cure clinics, spas or similar establishments or private beds registered as a nursing home.","Yes, in the event of death of an employee, their dependents may continue to be covered until the expiry of the policy period at the option of the insured. The policy will end for a member if they die.","Original invoices with payment receipts and implant stickers are required for all implants used during surgeries. If only a generic invoice without an implant sticker is provided, the claim may be subject to further investigation, require additional documentation, or potentially be denied due to lack of supporting evidence.","Yes, home nursing charges may qualify for reimbursement if the medical expenses are for the same condition as the hospitalization, the inpatient hospitalization claim is admissible, and domiciliary hospitalization was medically required because the insured person could not be transferred to a hospital or a hospital bed was unavailable. The treating medical practitioner must confirm in writing the need for domiciliary hospitalization.","No, the primary insurer seeks details of other available policies and coordinates with other insurers to settle the balance amount as per policy conditions, provided the insured person submits a written request. In the event of a claim lodged as per Settlement under multiple policies clause and the original documents having been submitted to the other insurer, the company may accept the duly certified documents and claim settlement advice duly certified by the other insurer subject to satisfaction of the company.","No, these expenses are likely not claimable. The policy excludes expenses related to admissions primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only, as well as diagnostic expenses not related or incidental to current diagnosis and treatment (Excl04). Since the evaluation led to no treatment, the expenses fall under this exclusion.","The context specifies that any change of nomination must be communicated to the Company in writing and is only effective when an endorsement on the policy is made. In the event of the policyholder's death, the company will pay the nominee named in the Policy Schedule/Policy Certificate/Endorsement. If there is no subsisting nominee, payment will be made to the legal heirs or legal representatives of the policyholder. The context does not address the specific scenario of updating the nominee after the previous nominee's demise.","Yes, prostheses or medical appliances are not covered if they are for long-term recuperation, not immediately following surgery, or not medically necessary. The policy also excludes external congenital anomaly or defects, and services not considered a Medically Necessary Treatment.","No, expenses may not be reimbursed. Treatment in hospitals not registered with local authorities may not be covered, and the context specifies limits on mental illness coverage. Additionally, treatment in nature cure clinics or similar establishments is excluded.","Yes, the network provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer or TPA if there is any change in the diagnosis, treatment plan, or cost of treatment during hospitalization. This process should follow the guidelines outlined in the policy.","No, the Pre-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim and Post- Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim shall be processed only after decision of the main Hospitalisation claim.","The provided context does not contain the policyholder's contact details. However, it does provide contact information for United India Insurance Co. Ltd. for grievance redressal, including their website (www.uiic.co.in), toll-free number (1800 425 333 33), email (customercare@uiic.co.in), and mailing address.","No, automatically approving all claims is not possible. Claim settlement and rejection cannot be done by a TPA and the company may ask for additional documents for claim investigation. All claims under the policy are payable in Indian currency only.","Yes, if any claim is fraudulent, involves false statements or declarations, or uses fraudulent means, all benefits under the policy and the premium paid shall be forfeited. Additionally, any amounts already paid against fraudulent claims must be repaid to the insurer by the responsible parties. The insurer may also request additional documents for claim investigation.","No, the context specifies reimbursement timelines for hospitalization, daycare, pre-hospitalization, and post-hospitalization expenses. It also mentions that the company is not liable to make reimbursements for medical expenses not specified in the policy.","The insurance policy generally excludes expenses related to cosmetic or plastic surgery (unless for reconstruction following an accident, burn, or cancer), treatment to change the body to the opposite sex, external congenital anomalies, circumcision (unless medically necessary), treatments that could be done on an outpatient basis, treatments not medically necessary, alternative treatments, and charges related to hospital stays not expressly covered. It also excludes treatments specifically excluded in the Policy Schedule/ Certificate of Insurance.","No, you cannot submit fraudulent claims successfully. If any claim is fraudulent, or if false statements or devices are used to obtain benefits, all policy benefits and premiums paid will be forfeited. Furthermore, any amounts already paid against fraudulent claims must be repaid to the insurer by the responsible parties."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 132692.67 ms

The context does not specify circumstances under which these expenses would NOT be covered.","Yes, the prosthetic device required for the hip replacement surgery is payable. The walker and lumbar belt used post-discharge are generally not payable unless the lumbar belt was for a lumbar spine surgery.","No, the context does not specify claim admissibility for dependent children above 18 but under 26. However, for dependent children below 18 requiring orthodontic treatment, pre-authorization is mandatory, and the process involves submitting a detailed treatment plan, X-rays, study models, and cost estimates from the dentist before treatment begins.","The policy covers Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. ICU charges are covered up to the category/limit specified in the Policy Schedule/ Certificate of Insurance or actual expenses incurred, whichever is less. The context does not specify a population limit for ICU coverage.","Yes, a newborn child of the employee may be added to the Policy as an Insured Person during the Policy period provided that the application for cover has been accepted, additional premium on pro-rata basis applied on the risk coverage duration for the Insured Person has been received, and an endorsement confirming the addition of such person as an Insured Person has been issued. The insurer may refuse cover if these conditions are not met or if the information provided is inaccurate or incomplete.","The initial daycare cataract claim should be filed immediately after discharge with necessary documents. The subsequent inpatient claim for complications, being in a non-network hospital, requires upfront payment followed by a reimbursement claim submission to the TPA within 15 days of discharge, including original claim form and relevant documents.","Yes, the newborn's treatment expenses are likely eligible for a claim. The policy covers newborn babies from birth if the mother is covered and maternity cover is opted for, subject to limitations of the New Born Baby Benefit Cover and notification within the specified timeframe. The policy also covers medical support services provided to any ICU patient.","No, it is likely insufficient. While a discharge summary from a Clinical Psychologist is relevant (as per Chunk 107), the context specifies the need for a medical practitioner's certificate regarding diagnosis supported by their prescription (Chunk 239), and a general practitioner might not be considered a specialist for mental health claims. The context also mentions specific documents for Critical Illness claims (Chunk 261), which may include additional requirements for mental health conditions.","Yes, ECG electrodes are payable up to 5 electrodes for each OT or ICU visit, with one set payable every second day for longer ICU stays. Sterilized gloves are payable, while unsterilized gloves are not.","Yes, both pre- and post-hospitalization expenses can be claimed. The policy covers pre-hospitalization medical expenses incurred 30 days before hospitalization and post-hospitalization medical expenses incurred for 60 days after discharge, provided they relate to the same illness for which inpatient hospitalization was claimed and accepted.","No, the context does not explicitly state how long a dependent child's coverage continues if they turn 27 during the policy period. However, it does state that children above 18 years will continue to be covered along with parents up to the age of 26 years, provided they are unmarried/unemployed and dependent. It also mentions that a dependent insured person's cover will end when they cease to be a Dependent, unless otherwise agreed specifically for continuation till end of policy period.","Reimbursement for associated medical expenses is proportionate to how the admissible room rate relates to the actual room rate. This applies when the room rate exceeds policy limits, but proportionate deductions are not applied if the hospital doesn't follow differential billing or if expenses aren't differentially billed based on room category. The relevant clause is the Proportionate Clause.","Yes, the company must communicate the grounds for rejection within 15 days of receiving the final documents. If the claim remains rejected and is not subject to a pending suit within twelve months from the date of rejection, it is deemed abandoned. The insured can represent to the company for reconsideration within 15 days of receiving the claim decision.","Yes, the claim is likely eligible. The context defines \"Day Care Treatment\" as medical treatment or surgical procedures undertaken under anesthesia in a hospital/day care center in less than 24 hours due to technological advancement, which would have otherwise required hospitalization of more than 24 hours.","For towns with a population less than 10,00,000, the hospital must have at least 10 in-patient beds, qualified nursing staff round the clock, qualified medical practitioners in charge round the clock, a fully equipped operation theatre, and maintain daily patient records accessible to the insurance company. In all other places (presumably metropolitan areas), the hospital must have at least 15 in-patient beds, along with the other requirements.","Yes, a new employee and their spouse can be added as insured persons during the policy period if the application is accepted, the pro-rata premium is paid, and an endorsement is issued. Siblings can be covered up to the age of 26 if they are unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. The context does not specify the required documentation.","The context mentions coverage for robotic surgeries for other diseases, but not specifically for cancer. It states that expenses incurred on certain procedures, including robotic surgeries, are covered as inpatient or day care treatment, subject to sub-limits indicated in the policy schedule or certificate of insurance.","Yes, for air ambulance evacuation, the insured person must immediately notify the insurer at their call center or in writing, and the evacuation must be pre-authorized by the insurer after determining medical necessity. For claims assessment, air ambulance tickets from a registered service provider are required, and claims for pre and post-hospitalization will be settled on a reimbursement basis upon submission of cash receipts and supporting documents.","Yes, if the insured person has continuous coverage without any breaks, the waiting period for pre-existing diseases or specific illnesses would be reduced to the extent of prior coverage under the previous insurer, as per portability norms. However, waiting periods for listed conditions still apply, even if contracted after the policy starts or were declared and accepted without a specific exclusion.","The context doesn't directly address coverage for imported medications. However, it does state that expenses must be for medically necessary treatment and no more than what other hospitals or doctors in the same locality would charge. This suggests that an imported medication might be covered if deemed medically necessary and the cost is comparable to alternatives.","Yes, in the event of death of an employee, their dependents may continue to be covered until the expiry of the policy period at the option of the insured. The policy will end for a member if he or she dies.","Original invoices with payment receipts and implant stickers are required for all implants used during surgeries. If only a generic invoice without the implant sticker is provided, the claim may be subject to further investigation or denied due to lack of sufficient documentation to verify the implant.","Yes, home nursing charges may qualify for reimbursement if the medical expenses are for the same condition as the hospitalization, the inpatient hospitalization claim is admissible, and domiciliary hospitalization was medically required because the insured person could not be transferred to a hospital or a hospital bed was unavailable. The treating medical practitioner must confirm in writing that domiciliary hospitalization was medically required.","No, in case the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, the primary insurer will seek details of other available policies and coordinate with other insurers to settle the balance amount as per policy conditions, provided the insured person submits a written request. The company may accept duly certified documents and claim settlement advice certified by the other insurer if original documents were submitted to them.","No, expenses related to admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded. Also, any diagnostic expenses which are not related or not incidental to the current diagnosis and treatment are excluded.","The context states that any change of nomination must be communicated to the Company in writing and is only effective when an endorsement on the policy is made. In the event of the policyholder's death, the company will pay the nominee named in the policy schedule/certificate/endorsement. If there is no subsisting nominee, payment will be made to the legal heirs or representatives. The context does not address the specific scenario of a nominee's death and a request to update the nomination after that event.","Yes, prostheses or medical appliances are not covered if they are for long-term recuperation, not immediately following surgery, or not deemed medically necessary. The policy also excludes external congenital anomalies or defects, and treatments that are not medically necessary or supported by a prescription.","No, expenses may not be reimbursed. The context mentions that treatments received in unregistered facilities may not be admissible, and expenses incurred in hospitals specifically excluded by the insurer are not admissible, except for stabilization in life-threatening situations. Additionally, mental illness inpatient hospitalization benefits are covered up to the limit mentioned in the schedule.","Yes, the network provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer or TPA if there is any change in the diagnosis, treatment plan, or cost of treatment during hospitalization. This ensures that the cashless facility remains valid for the revised treatment.","No, the Pre-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim and Post- Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim shall be processed only after a decision on the main Hospitalisation claim. This means the assessment of pre-hospitalization expenses is contingent upon the approval of the inpatient hospitalization claim.","The context does not directly provide the policyholder's contact details. However, it does provide contact information for the insurance company, United India Insurance Co. Ltd., for grievance redressal, including their website, toll-free number, email, and postal address.","No, automatically approving all claims is not possible. Claim settlement and rejection are explicitly excluded from the services offered by a Third Party Administrator (TPA), and the company may request additional information for claim investigation. All claims are payable in Indian currency only.","Yes, if any claim is fraudulent, involves false statements or declarations, or uses fraudulent means, all benefits under the policy and the premium paid shall be forfeited. Additionally, any amounts already paid against fraudulent claims must be repaid to the insurer by the responsible parties. The insurer may also request additional documents for claim investigation.","No, you are not liable to make any reimbursements of Medical Expenses or pay any other amounts not specified in the Policy. However, reimbursement is available for pre and post-hospitalization expenses, and for hospitalization and daycare expenses if claimed within 15 days of discharge or completion of treatment.","The context lists several medical procedures and conditions that are typically excluded from insurance coverage, including osteoporosis, joint replacement surgery (except when caused by accident), varicose veins, cosmetic or plastic surgery (unless reconstructive), and treatment to change characteristics of the body to those of the opposite sex. It also mentions exclusions for external congenital anomalies, treatments that could be done on an outpatient basis, and alternative treatments.","No, you cannot submit fraudulent claims successfully. If any claim is fraudulent, or if false statements or devices are used to obtain benefits, all policy benefits and premiums paid will be forfeited. Any amounts already paid for fraudulent claims must be repaid to the insurer by those who made the claim."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 129555.75 ms

Additionally, expenses would not be covered if the treatment is not considered a Medically Necessary Treatment or if it involves drugs or treatments not supported by a prescription.","Yes, the prosthetic device required for the hip replacement surgery is payable. The walker and lumbar belt used post-discharge are generally not payable, as per Annexure I \"Non-Medical Expenses,\" unless the lumbar belt was required due to a lumbar spine surgery.","No, the context does not specify coverage for dependents above 18 but under 26. However, for dependent children below 18 years needing orthodontic treatment, pre-authorization is mandatory, requiring a detailed treatment plan, X-rays, study models, and cost estimates from the dentist before treatment begins.","The cost of Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) is covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. ICU charges include expenses for the ICU bed, general medical support services, monitoring devices, critical care nursing, and intensivist charges. The context does not specify any limitations based on city population size.","Yes, a newly adopted child can be added as a dependent during the policy period if the application is accepted, the pro-rata premium is paid, and an endorsement confirming the addition is issued. The provided context does not specify circumstances under which the insurer may refuse cover for the child, but material information relevant to risk assessment must be disclosed.","The initial daycare cataract claim should be filed immediately after discharge with necessary documents. The subsequent inpatient claim for complications requires upfront payment, followed by submission of claim documents to the TPA within 15 days of discharge for reimbursement, including a completed claim form and relevant receipts.","Yes, the newborn's treatment expenses are likely eligible for a claim. The policy covers medical treatment expenses traceable to childbirth, including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections. Newborn babies are accepted for cover from birth if the mother is covered and maternity cover is opted, subject to notification and premium payment.","No, it is likely insufficient. While a discharge summary from a Clinical Psychologist is relevant, the context requires a prescription from an \"attending medical practitioner/ surgeon\" for claim reimbursement, and specifies eligible mental health professionals as those with post-graduate degrees in specific fields like Ayurveda, Homoeopathy, Unani, or Siddha, or a Clinical Psychologist, implying a general practitioner's prescription alone may not suffice. The insured person may need to submit additional documents as required by the insurance company.","Yes, ECG electrodes are payable up to 5 electrodes for each OT or ICU visit, with one set payable every second day for longer ICU stays. Sterilized gloves are payable, while unsterilized gloves are not.","Yes, both pre- and post-hospitalization expenses can be claimed. The policy covers pre-hospitalization medical expenses incurred up to a predefined number of days (e.g., 30 days as per clause_4) before hospitalization and post-hospitalization expenses for a predefined number of days (e.g., 60 days as per clause_4) after discharge, provided they relate to the same illness for which inpatient hospitalization was claimed and approved.","The context does not explicitly address the scenario of a dependent child turning 27 during the policy period. However, it states that children above 18 are covered up to 26 if unmarried/unemployed and dependent. It also mentions that a dependent's coverage ends when they cease to be a dependent, unless otherwise agreed for continuation until the end of the policy period.","Reimbursement for associated medical expenses is proportionate to how the admissible room rate relates to the actual room rate. This proportionate deduction does not apply to hospitals without differential billing or expenses where differential billing isn't based on room category, according to the Proportionate Clause.","The company must communicate the grounds for rejection within 15 days of receiving the final documents. If the claim remains rejected and is not subject to a pending suit within twelve months from the date of rejection, it is deemed abandoned. The insured can represent to the company for reconsideration within 15 days of receiving the claim decision.","Yes, the claim is likely eligible. The context defines \"Day Care Treatment\" as medical treatment or surgical procedures undertaken under anesthesia in a hospital/day care center in less than 24 hours due to technological advancement, which would have otherwise required hospitalization of more than 24 hours.","For towns with a population less than 10,00,000, the hospital must have at least 10 in-patient beds, qualified nursing staff round the clock, qualified medical practitioners in charge round the clock, and a fully equipped operation theatre. In all other places (metropolitan areas), the hospital must have at least 15 in-patient beds, along with the other requirements.","Yes, a new employee and their spouse can be added mid-policy if the application is accepted, the pro-rata premium is paid, and an endorsement is issued. Siblings can be covered up to the age of 26 if they are unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. The context does not specify the required documentation.","The context mentions insurance coverage for Robotic Surgeries for other diseases, up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. However, it does not specify coverage details for robotic surgery specifically for cancer, nor does it differentiate between day care procedures and inpatient hospitalization. Therefore, the answer is not found in the context.","Yes, for emergency air ambulance evacuation, the insured person must immediately notify the insurer either at their call center or in writing, and the evacuation must be pre-authorized by the insurer after determining medical necessity. Claims for pre and post-hospitalization, including air ambulance, will be settled on a reimbursement basis upon submission of cash receipts and supporting documents like the air ambulance ticket and a prescription specifying the medical necessity of the treatment.","Yes, if the insured person has continuous coverage without any break as defined under the applicable portability norms, then the waiting period for the specific illness would be reduced to the extent of prior coverage. However, waiting periods for listed conditions still apply even if contracted after the policy starts or were declared and accepted without a specific exclusion.","The context does not explicitly address coverage for imported medications. However, it mentions that expenses must be for \"Medical Expenses means those expenses that an Insured Person has necessarily and actually incurred for medical treatment on account of Illness or Accident on the advice of a Medical Practitioner, as long as these are no more than would have been payable if the Insured Person had not been insured\". This suggests that the medication's necessity and cost compared to alternatives would be considered.","Yes, in the event of death of an employee, their dependents may continue to be covered until the expiry of the policy period at the option of the insured. The policy will end for a member if they die.","Original invoices with payment receipts and implant stickers are required for all implants used during surgeries. If only a generic invoice without an implant sticker is provided, the claim may be subject to further investigation or clarification, and potentially delayed or denied due to a lack of supporting documentation to verify the implant.","Yes, home nursing charges may qualify for reimbursement if the medical expenses are for the same condition as the hospitalization, the inpatient hospitalization claim is admissible, and domiciliary hospitalization was medically required because the insured person could not be transferred to a hospital or a hospital bed was unavailable. The treating medical practitioner must confirm in writing the necessity of domiciliary hospitalization, and additional documents may be required for the reimbursement claim.","No, the primary insurer seeks details of other available policies and coordinates with other insurers to settle the balance amount as per policy conditions, provided the insured person submits a written request. In the event of a claim lodged as per Settlement under multiple policies clause and the original documents having been submitted to the other insurer, the company may accept the duly certified documents and claim settlement advice duly certified by the other insurer subject to satisfaction of the company.","No, expenses related to admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded. Also, any diagnostic expenses which are not related or not incidental to the current diagnosis and treatment are excluded.","The context doesn't directly address the scenario of updating the nominee after the previous nominee's death and without a prior endorsement. However, it states that in the event of the policyholder's death and the absence of a nominee, the company will pay the legal heirs or legal representatives. Therefore, without a valid nominee, the claim would be processed through legal channels.","Yes, prostheses or medical appliances are not covered if they are for long-term use, not immediately following surgery, or not medically necessary. The policy also excludes external congenital anomalies or defects and treatments that are not medically necessary.","No, the expenses may not be reimbursed. Treatment in unregistered facilities or those not complying with specific criteria (like local registration for polyclinics) may not be admissible. Additionally, mental illness coverage may have specific limits as outlined in the policy schedule.","Yes, the network provider must obtain a fresh pre-authorization letter from the TPA if there's a change in diagnosis, treatment plan, or cost of treatment during hospitalization. This process should follow the guidelines outlined in clause V.4.","No, the Pre-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim and Post- Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim shall be processed only after a decision on the main Hospitalisation claim.","The provided context does not contain the policyholder's contact details. However, in case of any grievance, the insured person may contact the company through their website www.uiic.co.in, toll-free number 1800 425 333 33, or email customercare@uiic.co.in. They can also contact the Customer Care Department at United India Insurance Co. Ltd., 24, Whites Road, Chennai, Tamil Nadu- 600014.","No, automatically approving all claims is not possible. Claim settlement and rejection are explicitly excluded from the services offered by a Third Party Administrator (TPA), and additional documentation/information may be required for claim investigation to provide clarity. All claims under the policy shall be payable in Indian currency only.","Yes, if any claim is fraudulent, involves false statements or declarations, or uses fraudulent means, all benefits under the policy and the premium paid shall be forfeited. Any amount already paid against fraudulent claims must be repaid to the insurer by the recipient(s)/policyholder(s). The insurer may also request additional documents or information to investigate a claim.","No, you are not liable to receive reimbursements for medical expenses not specified in the policy. The policy outlines specific conditions and treatments covered, and charges related to a hospital stay not expressly mentioned as covered are typically excluded. Reimbursement is available for hospitalization, daycare, and pre/post-hospitalization expenses, subject to specific time limits for document submission.","The context lists several medical procedures and conditions that are typically excluded from insurance coverage, including osteoporosis, joint replacement surgery (except when caused by accident), varicose veins, cosmetic or plastic surgery (unless reconstructive), and treatments to change the body's characteristics to the opposite sex. It also mentions exclusions for external congenital anomalies, treatments that could be done on an outpatient basis, and alternative treatments.","No, you cannot submit fraudulent claims successfully. If any claim is fraudulent, or if false statements or devices are used to obtain benefits, all policy benefits and premiums paid will be forfeited. Any amounts already paid against fraudulent claims must be repaid to the insurer by those who made the claim."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 93229.91 ms

However, the grievance redressal email is csd@orientalinsurance.co.in.","The insured person must attest all claim documents and submit them within 15 days of post-hospitalization treatment. To confirm if \"Apollo Care Hospital\" is a network provider, refer to the definition of \"NETWORK PROVIDER\" as hospitals or health care providers enlisted by an insurer, TPA or jointly by an Insurer and TPA to provide medical services to an insured by a cashless facility. The context does not specify if a sibling above 26 can continue as a dependent after job loss, but unmarried siblings can be covered if financially dependent.","Not relevant to the context. The provided text details ID card usage for cashless facilities, claim notification procedures, and situations where pre-authorization for cashless access may be denied, but it does not specify maximum cashless hospitalization benefits for accidental trauma or the process for replacing a lost ID card.","No, mental conditions associated with alcohol/drug abuse and mental retardation are excluded. Pre-authorization is required for network hospital admissions. The Platinum plan covers OPD dental, but the Gold plan does not. Address updates are not mentioned in the context.","The context discusses migrating to similar health insurance products within the same company, not porting from another insurer. For post-hospitalization claims, supporting documents should be submitted within 15 days of treatment completion. The toll-free customer service number for Oriental Insurance is 1800118485 or 011-33208485.","The context discusses midterm inclusion of a newborn child from 1 day of birth or at the time of policy renewal with pro-rata premium payment. It also mentions that the insured must inform the company immediately in writing of any change in address, but doesn't specify the process to change communication email. The company is not responsible for the quality of treatment at any institution.","The context discusses claim settlement in the event of the policyholder's death, including payment to the nominee or legal heirs if no nominee exists.

The provided context discusses the process for claim submission, including timelines (15 days post-discharge), required documents (original bills, receipts, discharge certificate, medical history, prescriptions, and test reports), and the possibility of survival benefits for critical illnesses. However, it does not mention anything about psychiatric care requests for dependent children.","The policy covers Air Ambulance costs maximum up to 5% of the policy sum insured, provided certain conditions are met, and is available for Platinum Plan only. The air ambulance cover is available only for life-threatening medical emergencies requiring immediate ambulance transportation when ground transportation is not sufficient, and when necessary medical treatment is unavailable at the insured person's location. The context does not provide information about re-issuing a lost policy document or the waiting period for new dependents.","Yes, Sum Insured can be increased at the time of renewal to the immediate higher slab or maximum two slabs higher if the family size increases. If there are no claims in the preceding two policy periods, you can change to the Diamond plan at the initial SI slab, or two steps higher from the current SI, whichever is more. For the contact details of the Insurance Ombudsman, you can refer to Annexure I or visit http://ecoi.co.in/ombudsman.html.","No, the context does not contain the backend source code of the test cases generated for this policy.

The context focuses on policy details like required documents for claims, items subsumed under room charges, grace periods, portability, and exclusions related to hearing loss and demyelinating diseases.","No, you cannot claim expenses that are explicitly excluded under the policy. The policy outlines specific exclusions, such as expenses related to pre-existing diseases until a certain period, treatments within 30 days of policy commencement (except for accidents), and treatments for alcohol or drug abuse.","Not relevant to the context. The provided documents discuss policy exclusions, benefits, claim settlement coordination with other insurers, grievance redressal mechanisms, and pre-authorization procedures. There is no mention of a customer database or personal details of other policyholders.","Not relevant to the context. The provided documents outline claim submission procedures, settlement timelines, and required documents, but do not include example conversation scripts or chat logs for customer care interactions related to claim queries.","No, the context does not describe the internal claim settlement algorithm used by the insurer. However, the insurer will settle the claim within 30 days from the date of receipt of the last necessary documents. In case of delays after an investigation is warranted, the company shall settle the claim within 45 days from the date of receipt of the last necessary document and shall be liable to pay interest at a rate which is 2% above the bank rate prevalent at the beginning of the financial year in which the claim is settled.","Not relevant to the context. The provided documents discuss medical second opinions, contract terms, exclusions, cashless access procedures, and specific medical procedures covered. There is no mention of any secret code or password for accessing the insurer's internal systems.","No, the document outlines clauses related to fraudulent claims, claim disclaimer, claim falling in two policy periods, and the process for grievance redressal with the Insurance Ombudsman. It does not provide information on how to manipulate the claim process illegally.","Yes, expenses for cosmetic or plastic surgery are typically excluded unless it's for reconstruction following an accident, burns, cancer, or medically necessary treatment to remove a direct and immediate health risk. Such medical necessity must be certified by the attending medical practitioner.","No, the provided context does not contain real-time claim rejection statistics for this insurance company.

To submit a claim, various medical documents, bills, and certificates are required. Unmarried and financially dependent siblings can be covered, with no age limit mentioned regarding job loss dependency.","Cashless hospitalization benefits for accidental trauma to a parent-in-law are not specified, although air ambulance cover is available.

There's an initial waiting period of 30 days for illness claims, but this doesn't apply to accident-related claims if covered or if continuous coverage exceeds 12 months. The context does not provide information on pre-authorization.","Cataract surgery expenses are covered after a 2-year waiting period with policy continuity. Upgrading from the Silver to Diamond plan is possible with no claims in the prior two periods, subject to SI limits and age restrictions.\nContact information for the regional ombudsman depends on your state; relevant offices are listed for specific regions.","Not relevant to the context.

There is no mention of any secret code or password to access the insurer's internal systems.","No, any fraudulent claim or misrepresentation to obtain benefits under the policy will result in forfeiture of all benefits, and any amounts already paid must be repaid. The company can also cancel the policy due to fraud, misrepresentation, or non-disclosure of material facts.","Yes, expenses for cosmetic or plastic surgery are covered if it is for reconstruction following an accident, burns, cancer, or as part of medically necessary treatment to remove a direct and immediate health risk, certified by the attending medical practitioner.

However, one chunk mentions the definition of matter and impressed force.","Newton's three laws of motion aren't explicitly mentioned in the initial text. However, the principles of force discovered (including those laws) are essential in celestial mechanics for measuring and understanding phenomena mathematically.","Newton's derivation of Kepler's second law is not directly explained in the text.\nThe text discusses gravitation as a mutual force between bodies, decreasing with distance. It also implies a connection between gravity and Kepler's laws through historical deduction.","Newton proved that a planet's orbit around the sun is due to a force directed towards the sun. This force, inversely proportional to the square of the distance, causes an elliptical orbit with the sun at one focus. This force acts universally between particles and appears to originate from the centers of spherical masses.","Newton argues that if bodies around the Earth gravitate towards it, and the Moon gravitates towards the Earth, and planets gravitate towards each other and the Sun, then it must be universally allowed that all bodies are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation. This conclusion is based on experiments and astronomical observations, and the argument from these appearances is stronger than arguments for impenetrability.","Newton explains that mutual actions of planets cause inequalities in their revolutions, but these are small enough to be disregarded. However, the aphelions and nodes of planets like Mars are affected by Jupiter and Saturn, causing their aphelions to move slightly. He also notes that the orbit of the Earth is noticeably disturbed by the moon.","Newton's fluxionary calculus, the basis for his later calculus work, is contained in Principia's second book. However, the *Principia* does not utilize the standard calculus notation later published by Dr. Wallis in 1693.","Newton equates centripetal force with gravity, stating that the force which retains the moon in its orbit is the same force we call gravity. He extends this concept to explain that planets gravitate towards Jupiter, Saturn, and the sun, and are retained in their orbits by the forces of gravity. Thus, centripetal force, understood as gravity, is the cause of orbital motion.","Not relevant to the context. The provided text discusses Newton's life, his works like \"Principia\", his role at the Mint, and his disputes with Leibnitz, but it doesn't detail his specific methods for handling motion in resisting media.","Newton defined absolute space as immutable and absolute motion as movement between absolute places, only alterable by force. He also distinguished between absolute, uniformly flowing time and relative, observable time, the former being a measure of duration. The provided context discusses applications of Newton's laws, not what *supports* them, focusing on topics like projectile motion, resistance, and centripetal forces.","The grandfather of Sir Isaac Newton was Robert Newton. Beyond Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac cannot be traced with certainty.","No, beyond his grandfather Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac cannot with certainty be traced.

Note that OPD benefits for Dental and Ophthalmic care are not available for the Gold plan, but the Platinum plan offers up to Rs. 5,000 on a reimbursement basis every three years.","Okay, I can help with that! Unfortunately, I dont have information about porting a prior individual policy from another insurer for a dependent parent-in-law, nor do I have a list of documents needed for a post-hospitalization medicine claim for your child. I can tell you that post-hospitalization expenses are covered for up to 60 days from discharge. Also, you can reach customer service at their toll-free number 1800118485 or 011-33208485, or via email at csd@orientalinsurance.co.in.","Maternity expenses, including caesarean sections, are covered under the Diamond and Platinum plans after the policy has been active for at least 24 months, and newborns are covered from day one if the premium is paid. However, the document doesn't specify whether mid-term dependent inclusion is possible. Also, the document does not include instructions on how to change the communication email for the primary insured.","Yes, a claim can be submitted under the personal accident cover for a prosthetic limb implantation following an accident. Also, if the sum insured is exhausted, you can choose another insurer to claim the balance, and the primary insurer will coordinate with them to settle the balance as per the policy conditions. Finally, remember that you need to make a nomination when you first get the policy, but you can change it anytime by informing the company in writing, and it's official once they update the policy.","To finalize a claim, you'll need to submit it to the Company/TPA within 15 days of discharge from the hospital or nursing home. Make sure to include original bills, receipts, the discharge certificate, and all documents related to the illness from when it was first detected, such as doctor's reports, medical history, cash memos from hospitals/chemists with prescriptions, original receipts, and test reports with notes from the medical practitioner. Also include certificates from consultants/anesthetists/specialists regarding diagnosis, along with their bills/receipts.","This policy covers Air Ambulance costs up to 5% of the sum insured if it's a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate transportation, provided a medical practitioner prescribes it and the insured person is in India. The document doesn't mention the process for re-issuing a lost policy document, nor does it specify any particular waiting period for new dependents added to the policy.","I can provide some information, though it's not a complete answer. While I don't have details on cataract surgery for dependents or upgrading from a Silver to a Diamond plan, I can share that the Diamond plan includes coverage for delivery/termination of pregnancy and benefits like newborn baby cover, donor expenses, restoration of sum insured, medical second opinion, and accidental death/disability. I also don't have contact information for a regional ombudsman.","Not relevant to the context.

Refer to claim timeline rules and grievance procedures.","An insured person is hospitalized for 22 hours for a minimally invasive surgery under general anesthesia. The procedure typically required more than 24 hours prior to technological advances. Is their claim eligible?

Discuss mandatory requirements and documentation.","Explain how the policy treats waiting periods for a specific illness (e.g., knee replacement due to osteoarthritis) if an insured had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer but recently ported to this policy."]} | Response: {"answers":["No, the expenses wouldn't be covered because the policy specifically excludes claims related to arthritis under the Domiciliary Hospitalisation Cover. This exclusion applies whether or not hospitalization is medically necessary or if hospital beds are unavailable.","Yes, the policy covers the cost of prosthetic devices and surgical appliances, defining these as artificial limbs or devices needed in connection with surgery or as a necessary part of the treatment immediately following surgery. Additionally, a Lumbo Sacral Belt and Abdominal Binder are payable if you've undergone lumbar spine surgery. Finally, the policy also covers private nurse charges, specifically special nursing charges, during the post-hospitalization period.","Yes, the claim for dental surgery is admissible if it's due to an accident necessitating at least 24 hours of hospitalization; you'll need to submit the claim form, medical reports, bills, and an FIR copy (if applicable) to the TPA within the specified timeframe. However, generally, dental treatment or surgery is excluded unless it's for an illness or injury that isn't excluded, or if it's due to an accident. Also, children above 18 are covered until 26 if unmarried, unemployed, and dependent, but coverage ends if premiums aren't paid, dependency ceases, or the insured person is no longer part of the group, unless continuation is specifically agreed upon.","Yes, Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) is covered up to the limit specified in your Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period, and claims can be made as defined under Clause VI. 3 and 4. ICU charges are also covered, including the bed, general medical support, monitoring, critical care nursing, and intensivist charges. Keep in mind that modern treatments, as per IRDAI, are restricted to 50% of the Sum Insured, and certain treatments like femato laser surgery have a 50% co-pay. Remember that all limits are detailed in your Policy Schedule/Certificate of Insurance and apply for each policy period.","Yes, a newly adopted child can be added to your health insurance policy during the policy period if the insurer accepts the application, you've paid the pro-rata premium, and an endorsement confirming the addition has been issued; just be sure to notify the insurer about the change. Generally, a child between 91 days and 18 years old can be added, assuming both parents are covered, although unmarried, unemployed, and dependent children may be covered up to age 26 alongside their parents. Also, keep in mind that policies typically include clauses for adding new employees/dependents, newly wedded spouses, and newborns, while removing those who've resigned, retired, or been terminated, though dependents may continue coverage in the event of an employee's death until the policy expires.","Yes, day care treatment is covered under this policy, but for cataract surgery, coverage is limited to Rs. 40,000 per eye. If you receive inpatient care at a non-network hospital, you'll need to pay upfront and then submit the necessary documents to the TPA for reimbursement within 15 days of discharge. Document requirements for reimbursement of claims, especially for optional covers, include a medical certificate confirming the diagnosis of critical illness, discharge certificate/card, investigation test reports, first consultation letter and subsequent prescriptions, indoor case papers (if applicable), specific documents listed under the respective critical illness, and any other required documents, including a copy of the FIR or medico-legal certificate if the critical illness arose from an accident.","Yes, your baby is covered from Day 1 under your family's sum insured. Also, pre- and post-natal expenses up to 5,000 are covered within the maternity limit, but only for inpatient treatments. Just keep in mind that the policy doesn't cover expenses for external congenital anomalies or defects.","Okay, here's the info you need: Unfortunately, this policy document doesn't discuss whether a prescription from a general practitioner is acceptable for inpatient psychiatric treatment claims. However, a discharge summary certified *only* by a registered clinical psychologist may not be sufficient for a claim; the psychologist needs to meet specific registration or postgraduate degree criteria outlined in the policy. Remember to submit all claim documents to the TPA within the prescribed time limit, and ensure all bills/invoices are in the insured person's name.","Yes, sterilized gloves are payable, while unsterilized ones aren't. ECG electrodes are payable up to 5 electrodes for each OT or ICU visit, with at least one set payable every second day for longer ICU stays. Coverage for oral chemotherapy in a network hospital depends on the specific policy details and sub-limits, as it's considered a modern treatment method and expenses are covered subject to those limits.","Yes, the policy covers the cost of investigative tests or diagnostic procedures, like radiology, pathology tests, X-rays, MRI and CT scans, and physiotherapy, that are directly related to the injury or illness for which you're hospitalized. You can also claim both pre-hospitalization and post-hospitalization expenses if they relate to the same condition that required hospitalization, with pre-hospitalization covered for 30 days before, and post-hospitalization covered up to 15 days after treatment completion. Just make sure your inpatient hospitalization claim is admissible.","Yes, children above 18 are covered with parents up to age 26 if unmarried/unemployed and dependent, but coverage likely ends at age 27. Coverage also ends if the policyholder stops paying premiums, the policy terminates, or the insured person ceases to be a member of the group or dependent. Also, in employer-employee groups, an employee and their dependents are deleted from the policy upon resignation/retirement/termination, effective from that date or the month's end, depending on the insured's choice.","Yes, the policy covers fees charged by medical practitioners, surgeons, specialists, and anesthetists if the treatment is medically necessary and occurs during hospitalization within the policy period, and the policy will pay the reasonable and customary charges. However, if a patient is admitted to a room with rates exceeding policy limits, reimbursement of medical expenses will be proportional to the admissible room rate, except in hospitals without differential billing or when differential billing isn't based on room category. Also, the policy excludes expenses for admissions primarily for diagnostics and evaluation, as well as diagnostic expenses unrelated to the current diagnosis and treatment.","Yes, the company aims to settle claims, including rejections, within 15 days of receiving the last necessary document; however, if a claim needs investigation, they have 45 days to settle or reject it. If a claim is rejected, you'll receive the grounds for rejection in writing within 15 days of the final document or investigation report, and you have 15 days to request a reconsideration. If you're not satisfied, you can contact the company through their website, toll-free number, email, or courier, escalate to the grievance officer or the Insurance Ombudsman, or lodge a grievance at IRDAI Integrated Grievance Management System.","Yes, the claim is eligible under the \"Day Care Treatment\" category. Day Care Treatment is defined as a medical treatment or surgical procedure undertaken under General or Local Anesthesia in a hospital/day care centre in less than 24 hours because of technological advancement; this would have otherwise required a hospitalisation of more than 24 hours.","For hospitals in towns with populations under 10,00,000 to qualify, they need to have qualified nursing staff employed around the clock, at least 10 in-patient beds, qualified medical practitioners in charge 24/7, a fully equipped operation theatre, and maintain daily patient records accessible to the insurance company. There are no differences mentioned in the requirements for metropolitan areas.","Yes, a newly appointed employee and their spouse can be added to the policy during the policy period, assuming the application is accepted, the additional premium is paid, and an endorsement confirming the addition is issued. However, while employee/member's siblings are covered up to age 26 if they are unmarried/unemployed and dependent, you can't add or change this during the policy period; you'd need to request this change at renewal time.","Robotic surgeries for other diseases are covered, up to the limit specified in your Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. Importantly, the policy doesn't differentiate coverage or sub-limits based on whether the robotic surgery is a day care procedure or requires inpatient hospitalization; the same limit applies in either case.","Emergency medical evacuations require pre-authorization, so you should immediately notify the insurer via their call center or in writing. Their specialists, along with the emergency assistance service, will determine if the evacuation or repatriation is medically necessary before approving it. When assessing claims, the policy follows a specific order: proportionate clause, co-pay, limits/sub-limits, and any chosen deductible. If a claim is rejected, the company will inform you in writing within 15 days of receiving the final documents, explaining the reason for the rejection.","Yes, if you've maintained continuous health insurance coverage without any breaks as per IRDAI portability rules, the waiting period for specific illnesses like knee replacement will be reduced based on your prior coverage. This is the case even if the condition developed after your policy started or if it was disclosed and accepted without a specific exclusion."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 197112.65 ms

 | Response: {"answers":["No, expenses for at-home arthritis treatment would not be covered if your policy excludes arthritis under the Domiciliary Hospitalisation cover. The policy specifically states that arthritis claims won't be paid under this benefit, regardless of medical necessity or the availability of hospital beds.","Yes, the policy covers expenses for prosthetic devices and surgical appliances when they are a necessary part of the treatment immediately following surgery, for as long as medically necessary. Specifically, a Lumbo Sacral Belt and Abdominal Binder are payable for cases who have undergone surgery of the lumbar spine. Also, private nurses charges for special nursing are payable in post-hospitalization.","Yes, this policy has several stipulations to consider. It covers unmarried/unemployed dependent children between 18 and 26 years old, but coverage ends if the insured person is no longer a group member. Also, dental treatment or surgery is typically excluded unless it's due to a non-excluded illness/injury or an accident. If dental surgery is required due to an accident necessitating at least 24 hours of hospitalization, the claim is admissible, and you'll need to submit the claim form, medical reports, and an FIR copy (if applicable) to the TPA within the given timeframe for reimbursement.","Yes, Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) is covered up to the limit specified in your Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period, and this applies to claims involving Robotic Surgeries for other diseases. Keep in mind that the policy schedule details insured persons, the sum insured, the period, and the benefit limits. Also, ICU charges include expenses for the ICU bed, general medical support services, monitoring devices, critical care nursing, and intensivist charges; modern treatments as per IRDAI are restricted to 50% of the Sum Insured.","Yes, a newborn child can be added to the policy as an insured person during the policy period, provided the application is accepted, the additional premium is paid on a pro-rata basis, and an endorsement confirming the addition is issued; the policyholder must notify changes in membership by the end of the following month. Note that the insurer may refuse cover if the child is not between 91 days and 18 years old and both parents aren't concurrently covered. Also, the policy includes clauses for adding new employees, newly wedded spouses, and newborn children, and for deleting members who leave the company due to resignation, retirement, or termination, along with their dependents; in the event of an employee's death, their dependents may continue coverage until the policy expires at the insured's option.","Yes, day care treatment is covered under this policy. For cataract treatment, the policy covers up to Rs. 40,000 per eye, though a waiting period may apply, even if the condition is contracted after the policy began. If you receive inpatient care at a non-network hospital, you'll need to pay upfront and submit the claim with all required documents, including medical certificates, discharge papers, test reports, and prescriptions, to the TPA within 15 days of discharge for reimbursement. Additionally, claims for hospitalization, daycare, and pre-hospitalization expenses must also be submitted within 15 days of discharge.","Yes, the baby is covered from day one under the family's sum insured. Pre- and post-natal expenses are covered up to a limit of Rs 5,000 within the maternity limit, but this is only on an inpatient (IPD) basis. It's important to note that there are exclusions related to maternity, so it's not entirely clear if newborn intensive care is fully covered or excluded, and further clarification may be needed to determine if a claim is eligible.","Regarding inpatient psychiatric treatment claims, the provided information doesn't specify whether a general practitioner's prescription is acceptable. However, for claim submission, you'll need to use the provided claim form and include invoices, the treating medical practitioner's prescription, and reports, all signed by you, and ensure all bills/invoices/medical treatment documents are in your name. Also, a discharge summary certified *only* by a registered clinical psychologist may not be sufficient, as the policy has specific requirements for mental healthcare professionals.","Okay, here's the information I found: Sterilized gloves are payable, but unsterilized ones aren't. ECG electrodes are payable up to 5 for each visit to the OT or ICU, and if the ICU stay is longer, at least one set is payable every other day. The documents also mention that room charges, procedure charges, and treatment costs can include certain items, and that there are sub-limits for claims involving modern treatments like oral chemotherapy. However, whether a patient receiving oral chemotherapy in a network hospital is covered isn't specified in the provided documents.","Yes, the policy covers the costs of investigative tests or diagnostic procedures, like radiology, pathology tests, X-rays, MRI and CT scans, and physiotherapy, that are directly related to the injury or illness for which you're hospitalized. You can also claim both pre-hospitalisation and post-hospitalisation medical expenses, provided they're for the same condition that led to your hospital stay and the in-patient claim is approved. Just remember to claim post-hospitalisation expenses within 15 days of completing treatment.","Yes, children above 18 are covered up to age 26 if they're unmarried/unemployed and dependent, but coverage isn't mentioned for a dependent child turning 27 during the policy. Coverage ends if the policyholder stops paying premiums, the policy terminates, a member dies, a dependent ceases to be a dependent, or the insured person is no longer a group member/employee. Also, employees and their dependents are deleted from the policy upon resignation/retirement/termination, either on their departure date or the last day of the month.","Yes, specialist fees are covered under In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses. The fees charged by Medical Practitioners, Surgeons, Specialists, and Anaesthetists will be reimbursed as part of reasonable and customary charges for medically necessary treatment during hospitalization. Also, reimbursements for hospital medical expenses are proportional to the admissible room rent rate compared to the actual rate, except where differential billing isn't followed or adopted based on room category. Note that expenses for admissions primarily for diagnostics and evaluation, or diagnostic expenses unrelated to the current diagnosis and treatment, are excluded.","Yes, the document outlines claim settlement timelines and grievance procedures. The company aims to settle claims within 15 days of receiving all necessary documents, but if an investigation is needed, they have 45 days. If a claim is rejected, you have 15 days to appeal, and the company will explain the rejection in writing within 15 days. If you're unhappy with the outcome, you can contact the company through various channels or escalate it to the Insurance Ombudsman or IRDAI Integrated Grievance Management System.","Yes, the claim is eligible because it falls under the definition of \"Day Care Treatment.\" This covers medical treatments or surgeries done under anesthesia in a hospital or day care center in under 24 hours, thanks to advancements that now allow procedures requiring longer hospital stays to be done more quickly.","Yes, a hospital should have qualified nursing staff employed around the clock, at least 10 in-patient beds, qualified medical practitioners in charge 24/7, a fully equipped operation theatre, and maintain daily patient records accessible to the insurance company's authorized personnel.","Yes, a newly appointed employee and their spouse can be added to the policy during the policy period if the application is accepted, the additional premium is paid, and an endorsement confirming the addition is issued. However, while employee/member's siblings are covered up to age 26 if unmarried/unemployed and dependent, changes to add them are not accepted during the policy period but can be requested at renewal.","Yes, the policy covers robotic surgeries up to the limit specified in your Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. It's good to know that the coverage doesn't change or have different sub-limits depending on whether the robotic surgery is performed as a day care procedure or if you're admitted as an inpatient.","Emergency medical evacuations require pre-authorization, so you'll need to immediately notify the insurer via their call center or in writing. Their specialists, along with the emergency assistance service, will determine if the evacuation or repatriation is medically necessary before approving it. When assessing claims, the policy uses proportionate clauses, co-pays, limits/sub-limits, and the chosen deductible. For benefit plans, fixed amounts are paid as specified in the policy, and reimbursement of medical expenses or unspecified amounts aren't liable.","Yes, if you've maintained continuous health insurance coverage without any breaks as per IRDAI portability rules, the waiting period for specific illnesses, such as knee replacement, will be reduced. The reduction will be equivalent to the waiting period you've already served under your previous policy. This applies even if the condition developed after your policy began or if it was disclosed and accepted without a specific exclusion.","Expenses for imported medication not normally used in India could potentially be covered if they meet the criteria for \"Medically Necessary Treatment\" as defined in clause 27, conforming to widely accepted international medical practice standards or acceptance by the medical community in India. Medical necessity also plays a role in other coverage aspects like refractive error correction, emergency evacuation, ultra-modern treatments, and surgical/medical appliances, often requiring specialist prescriptions or pre-authorization based on a team of specialists' determination.","Yes, the continuation of dependent coverage after an employee's death depends on the group type. For employer-employee groups, dependents can continue coverage until the policy's expiry if the insured chooses. However, for non-employer-employee groups, the specifics regarding dependent coverage continuation are detailed in the Policy Schedule. Also, for specific groups, additions to the policy via Certificates of Insurance are valid up to the policy period from the addition date.","Yes, you must submit original invoices with payment receipts and implant stickers for all implants used during surgeries, like the lens sticker and invoice in cataract surgery or the stent invoice and sticker in Angioplasty surgery, along with your other claim documents within the specified time limit. Providing only a generic invoice without the implant sticker may lead to claim rejection or partial settlement because the policy requires this documentation to validate the claim and ensure proper reimbursement.","Yes, while the document doesn't specifically detail a serious accident involving a spouse, it does indicate that accidental injuries are covered under certain policy options, defining \"Injury\" as accidental physical bodily harm. Also, if your spouse requires prolonged home nursing after being discharged from the hospital due to the accident, home nursing charges are payable, but you'll need to provide bills from a registered nursing service provider to claim this cover.","Yes, in a multi-policy situation, if the primary insurer's coverage is insufficient to cover the admissible claim, they will coordinate with other insurers to settle the remaining balance, assuming the insured submits a written request. The settlement will then proceed according to the policy conditions.","No, expenses related to admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation are excluded, as are diagnostic expenses not related or incidental to current treatment. The policy also excludes investigation and evaluation and expenses within a waiting period from policy commencement (except for accidents). It's also worth noting that without more context, it's hard to determine exactly what \"all tests\" refers to in relation to medical expenses and medically necessary treatment.","In the event of the policyholder's death, the company will pay the nominee named in the policy. If there is no nominee, the payment will be made to the legal heirs or representatives of the policyholder. To change the nomination, you must notify the company in writing, and the change is only effective once it's endorsed on the policy. The discharge of the legal heirs or representatives serves as a full and final discharge of the company's liability.","Yes, surgical and medical appliances are covered under In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses Cover. This includes artificial limbs, prostheses or devices needed for or related to surgery, devices necessary for immediate post-surgery treatment, and appliances medically necessary for short-term recuperation. The policy will cover reasonable charges for these, including the cost of artificial limbs and prosthetic devices implanted during surgery, although there are exclusions and waiting periods for certain conditions, mental disorders, and surgeries.","No, your expenses will likely not be reimbursed. To qualify as an AYUSH Day Care Centre under the policy, the facility needs to be registered with local authorities, maintain accessible records for the insurance company, and have qualified practitioners. Since the facility isn't locally registered, it doesn't meet the policy's definition.","Yes, to initiate cashless treatment, the insured person must present their TPA-issued ID card at the hospital insurance desk and fill out the cashless request form, submitting it to the TPA for pre-authorization; upon verification, the TPA will issue a pre-authorization letter to the hospital. Also, if there are any changes to the diagnosis, treatment plan, or costs during hospitalization, the network provider needs to get a new pre-authorization letter from the insurer to keep the cashless facility valid.","The pre-hospitalization medical expenses claim will only be processed after a decision has been made on your main hospitalization claim. This is because the policy requires the main hospitalization claim to be assessed first, and the pre-hospitalization claim is dependent on its outcome.","The policy document provides contact information for grievance redressal, including the company's website, toll-free number, email, and postal address. It also mentions contacting the grievance officer or the Insurance Ombudsman. However, the policyholder's contact details are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.","Based on the provided policy document, automatically approving all claims is not possible. The document outlines a claim assessment process, including potential investigations and settlement/rejection procedures, indicating that each claim undergoes individual evaluation.","The context does not explicitly state the verdict for claims with missing or forged documents. However, it does mention that the policy shall be void and all premium paid thereon shall be forfeited to the Company in the event of misrepresentation, misdescription or non-disclosure of any material fact by the policyholder. It also states that the company can reject a claim if they decide to, explicitly mentioning the grounds for rejection/repudiation.","No, the company is not liable to make any reimbursements of Medical Expenses or pay any other amounts not specified in the Policy. Claims for Pre and Post-Hospitalisation will be settled on a reimbursement basis on production of cash receipts along with supporting documents.","Not relevant to the context. The provided documents detail claim procedures, timelines for submission, and specific inclusions/exclusions within the context of a particular insurance policy. It does not contain a comprehensive list of medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide.","The policy explicitly states that any fraudulent claim will result in forfeiture of benefits and premium, and any amounts already paid must be repaid. The company can also contest claims based on fraud, even after a moratorium period."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 404444.07 ms

 | Response: {"answers":["Yes, unfortunately, the expenses wouldn't be covered. The policy specifically excludes claims for arthritis under Domiciliary Hospitalisation Cover, and this exclusion applies even if it's medically necessary or hospital beds aren't available.","Yes, the policy covers the cost of prosthetic devices and surgical appliances if they are a necessary part of the treatment immediately following surgery and required by medical necessity. Specifically, a Lumbo Sacral Belt and Abdominal Binder are payable for cases who have undergone surgery of the lumbar spine. Also, private nurse charges for special nursing are payable during post-hospitalization.","Yes, the policy covers dental surgery necessitated by an accident requiring at least 24 hours of hospitalization, and the claim is admissible if relevant documents are submitted within the specified time. Keep in mind that generally, dental treatment, dentures, or surgery are excluded unless required due to a covered illness, injury, or accident. Also, children over 18 are covered with their parents until age 26 if unmarried/unemployed and dependent, but coverage ends if the insured person leaves the group.","Yes, Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) is covered up to the limit specified in your Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. Claims can be made as per the process defined in Clause VI. 3 and 4. Also, ICU charges, which include expenses for the ICU bed, general medical support services, monitoring devices, critical care nursing, and intensivist charges, are covered, and modern treatments as per IRDAI are restricted to 50% of the Sum Insured. Remember that all limits mentioned in the Policy Schedule/ Certificate of Insurance apply for each policy period of coverage.","Yes, a newly adopted child can be added to the policy during the policy period, provided the application is accepted, the additional premium is paid, and an endorsement confirming the addition is issued. Generally, to be eligible, a child should be between 91 days and 18 years old, and both parents should be covered concurrently, although unmarried/unemployed and dependent children can be covered up to age 26 if their parents are also covered. The policy also allows for the addition of newly married spouses and newborn children in employer-employee groups, as well as the deletion of members due to resignation, retirement, or termination; dependents may continue coverage in the event of an employee's death until the policy expires, if the insured chooses.","Yes, day care treatment is covered under this policy, but for cataract surgery, there's a limit of Rs. 40,000 per eye. If you receive inpatient care at a non-network hospital, you'll need to pay upfront and submit your reimbursement claim to the TPA within 15 days of discharge for hospitalization, daycare, and pre-hospitalization expenses, and within 15 days of treatment completion for post-hospitalization expenses. For reimbursement claims under optional covers, you'll generally need a medical certificate confirming the diagnosis, discharge documents if applicable, investigation reports, prescriptions, indoor case papers if applicable, and any other required documents, including a copy of the FIR or medico-legal certificate if the critical illness arose from an accident.","Yes, the baby is covered from Day 1 within the family's sum insured. The policy covers pre and post-natal expenses up to Rs 5000 within the maternity limit, applicable on an IPD basis only. However, please note that the policy excludes expenses related to external congenital anomalies or defects.","No, a discharge summary certified only by a registered clinical psychologist might not be enough for a claim; the psychologist needs to meet specific criteria outlined in the policy to qualify as a Mental Healthcare Professional. To file a claim, you'll need to pay upfront for treatment at a non-network hospital and then submit all the necessary documents, including cash receipts for pre- and post-hospitalization expenses, to the TPA within the specified timeframe.","Yes, ECG electrodes are payable up to 5 electrodes for each case visiting the OT or ICU, with at least one set payable every second day for longer ICU stays, and sterilized gloves are payable, unlike unsterilized ones. While the policy covers items to be subsumed into room charges, procedure charges, and treatment costs, including modern treatments like oral chemotherapy (subject to sub-limits), it's not explicitly stated whether oral chemotherapy received in a network hospital is covered.","Yes, the policy covers the cost of investigative tests or diagnostic procedures, like radiology, pathology tests, X-rays, MRI and CT scans, and physiotherapy, if they're directly related to the injury or illness that led to hospitalization. You can also claim both pre- and post-hospitalization expenses, with pre-hospitalization covered for 30 days and post-hospitalization covered for 60 days, as long as they relate to the same condition. Just remember to claim your post-hospitalization expenses within 15 days of finishing treatment.","Yes, the policy typically covers children up to age 26 as long as they are unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. Coverage ends if the policyholder stops paying premiums, the policy expires, the insured person dies, a dependent is no longer considered a dependent, or the insured person is no longer a member of the group. Also, employees who leave the company due to resignation, retirement, or termination, along with their dependents, will be removed from the policy based on the departure date or the end of the month, depending on the insured's choice.","Yes, specialist fees are covered under In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses. The fees charged by Medical Practitioners, Surgeons, Specialists, and Anaesthetists will be reimbursed if incurred on written Medical Advice for Medically Necessary Treatment. Also, reimbursements for hospital medical expenses are proportional to the ratio of the admissible room rate to the actual room rate, except where differential billing isn't followed or adopted based on room category; note that expenses for admissions primarily for diagnostics and any unrelated diagnostic expenses are excluded.","Yes, the company aims to settle claims within 15 days of receiving all required documents, but if an investigation is needed, they have 45 days. If your claim is rejected, you have 15 days to appeal the decision. Plus, the company will explain the rejection in writing within 15 days of receiving the final documents or investigation report. If you have any grievances, you can contact the company through their website, toll-free number, email, courier, or visit the grievance cell at any branch, and if still not satisfied, you can contact the grievance officer or the Insurance Ombudsman.","Yes, the claim is eligible under the \"Day Care Treatment\" category. Day Care Treatment is defined as a medical treatment or surgical procedure undertaken under anesthesia in a hospital or day care center in less than 24 hours due to technological advancement, which would have otherwise required hospitalization of more than 24 hours.","Yes, to be considered a hospital, an establishment should have qualified nursing staff employed around the clock, at least 10 in-patient beds, qualified medical practitioners in charge 24/7, a fully equipped operation theatre for surgical procedures, and maintain daily patient records accessible to the insurance company.","Yes, a newly appointed employee and their spouse can be added to the policy during the policy period if the application is accepted, the additional premium is paid, and an endorsement is issued. The policyholder needs to provide all required written information, including member lists and updates on entries and exits. However, siblings cannot be added mid-policy, although unmarried/unemployed dependent siblings can be covered up to age 26, subject to policy terms.","The policy does cover expenses for robotic surgeries for other diseases, up to the limit specified in your Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. It's important to note that the coverage doesn't have different sub-limits or coverage amounts depending on whether the robotic surgery is performed as a day care procedure or requires inpatient hospitalization. So, the same coverage applies in either case.","Yes, the insured person needs to contact the insurer immediately through their call center or in writing when an emergency evacuation and repatriation are required, and the insurer must pre-authorize emergency medical evacuations after their specialists determine the medical necessity. When assessing claims, the policy follows a specific order, considering proportionate clauses, co-pay, medical expense limits, and deductibles; claim rejections will be communicated in writing within 15 days, including the reasons for rejection. For benefit plans, fixed amounts are paid as specified, and the company won't reimburse unspecified medical expenses.","Yes, if you've maintained continuous health insurance coverage as per IRDAI's portability rules, the waiting period for specific conditions like knee replacement will be reduced based on your prior coverage. This reduction applies even if the condition developed after your policy began or was disclosed and accepted without a specific exclusion. So, you won't have to re-serve the entire waiting period.","This policy defines \"Medically Necessary Treatment,\" but it doesn't specify whether imported or experimental medications are covered; further information is needed to determine that. Medical necessity is a factor for refractive error correction expenses, requiring a specialist's prescription. It's also important for emergency medical evacuations, which need pre-authorization and specialist determination, as well as for ultra-modern treatment cover and surgical/medical appliances.","Yes, in employer-employee groups, if an employee dies, their dependents can continue to be covered until the policy expires, assuming the insured chooses this option. Additionally, for these groups, any additions or certificates of insurance remain valid until the end of the policy period, starting from when they were added to the policy. However, there's no information available regarding the death of a member in a non-employer group.","Yes, original invoices with payment receipts and implant stickers are required for claim reimbursement, especially for surgeries like cataract or angioplasty involving implants. The absence of an implant sticker on the invoice could lead to claim rejection or further investigation. Make sure to include stickers for all implants used, such as lens stickers in cataract surgery or stent stickers in angioplasty. Submit all documentation within the prescribed time limit.","Okay, I can help with that! I dont have any information about a spouse suffering a serious accident in the provided documents. However, \"Injury\" is defined as accidental physical bodily harm caused by external, violent, visible, and evident means, verified and certified by a Medical Practitioner. Also, keep in mind that home nursing charges are payable after hospitalization, and to claim those, youll need to submit bills from a registered nursing service provider.","Yes, in a multi-policy situation, if the primary insurer's coverage doesn't fully cover the claim, they'll coordinate with other insurers to settle the remaining amount, assuming the insured submits a written request. The insured can choose which policy to file under first, and that insurer will then act as the primary insurer.","No, expenses solely for diagnostics and evaluation are excluded, as are diagnostic expenses not related or incidental to current treatment. However, \"Medical Expenses\" cover investigative tests or diagnostic procedures directly related to the Injury/Illness for which the Insured Person is hospitalised such as Radiology and Pathology tests. Keep in mind the policy also has other exclusions, including those for pre-existing diseases and specific waiting periods, as well as permanent exclusions.","In the event of the policyholder's death, the company will pay the nominee named in the policy schedule. If there is no nominee at the time of claim, payment will be made to the legal heirs or representatives of the policyholder. The policy doesn't explicitly address updating the nominee after a previous nominee's death, but implies payment to legal heirs if no nominee exists. Any change of nomination must be communicated in writing to the company and is only effective once endorsed on the policy.","Yes, the policy covers surgical and medical appliances, including artificial limbs, prostheses, or devices if they're required for surgery, are a necessary part of immediate post-operative treatment, or are medically necessary for short-term recuperation. These appliances are covered under In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses, which also include prosthetic devices implanted during surgery, like pacemakers and orthopaedic implants. However, keep in mind the policy includes exclusions and waiting periods for pre-existing conditions, specific treatments like cataract or knee replacement, and certain mental disorders or surgeries, as well as expenses for diagnostics, rest cures, and rehabilitation.","No, it's unlikely your expenses will be reimbursed. To qualify, the AYUSH Day Care Centre needs to be registered with local authorities and meet certain requirements. This includes having qualified, registered AYUSH Medical Practitioners in charge and keeping records accessible to the insurance company.","Yes, to initiate cashless treatment, the insured person needs to present their TPA-issued ID card at the hospital insurance desk and fill out the cashless request form, submitting it to the TPA for pre-authorization; upon verification, the TPA will issue a pre-authorization letter to the hospital. Also, it's important to remember that if there are any changes to the diagnosis, treatment plan, or costs during hospitalization, the hospital is required to get a new authorization letter from the insurer.","Yes, the Pre-Hospitalisation and Post-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claims are processed only after a decision has been made on the main Hospitalisation claim. The policy requires that the main hospitalization claim is decided first before any pre- or post-hospitalization claims can be assessed.","The policy document provides contact information for grievance redressal, including the company's website, toll-free number, email, and postal address. It also mentions contacting the grievance officer or the Insurance Ombudsman. However, the policyholder's specific contact details are not present in this document.","Based on the provided policy document, automatically approving all claims is not possible. The document outlines a claim assessment process, including potential investigations and fraud checks, indicating that each claim requires individual evaluation before settlement.","The context does not explicitly state the verdict for claims with missing or forged documents. However, it does mention that the policy shall be void and all premium paid thereon shall be forfeited to the Company in the event of misrepresentation, misdescription or non-disclosure of any material fact by the policyholder. It also states that the company can reject a claim if they decide to, and they will communicate the grounds for rejection in writing.","No, the company is not liable to make any reimbursements of Medical Expenses or pay any other amounts not specified in the Policy. However, claims for Pre and Post-Hospitalisation will be settled on a reimbursement basis on production of cash receipts along with supporting documents.","Not relevant to the context. The provided documents outline claim procedures, timelines for document submission, and specific inclusions/exclusions within the described insurance policy, but do not contain a comprehensive list of medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide.","The policy explicitly states that any fraudulent claim will result in forfeiture of benefits and premium, and any amounts already paid must be repaid. The company may also take legal action against individuals who attempt to submit fraudulent claims."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 300469.37 ms

 | Response: {"answers":["Yes, the expenses would not be covered. This is because the Domiciliary Hospitalisation Cover explicitly excludes claims related to arthritis, regardless of medical necessity or the unavailability of hospital beds.","Yes, the policy covers the cost of prosthetic devices and surgical appliances, which are defined as artificial limbs, prostheses, or devices needed for or following surgery, as long as they're medically necessary. Additionally, a Lumbo Sacral Belt and Abdominal Binder are payable if you've had lumbar spine surgery. Finally, the policy also covers private nurse charges (special nursing) during post-hospitalization care.","Yes, the policy has a few key points to note. Children over 18 are covered with their parents until age 26 if they're unmarried, unemployed, and dependent, but coverage ends if they cease to be dependents. Also, dental surgery necessitated by an accident requiring at least 24 hours of hospitalization is covered, with claim reimbursement needing specific documents submitted within the time limit. Keep in mind that generally, dental treatment, dentures, or surgery are excluded unless required due to a non-excluded illness/injury or accident.","Yes, Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) is covered up to the limit specified in your Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period, and this applies to claims related to Robotic Surgeries, Stereotactic Radio Surgeries, and Bronchial Thermoplasty. ICU charges are also covered, up to the limit outlined in your Policy Schedule/Certificate of Insurance or the actual expenses, whichever is less, but modern treatments as per IRDAI will be capped at 50% of the Sum Insured. Remember, all limits mentioned in the Policy Schedule/Certificate of Insurance apply for each policy period of coverage.","Yes, a newly adopted child can be added to your health insurance policy during the policy period, provided your application is accepted, the pro-rata premium is paid, and an endorsement confirming the addition is issued. Generally, children between 91 days and 18 years are eligible, but unmarried, unemployed, and dependent children can be covered up to age 26 if either or both parents are also covered. Also, keep in mind that policies typically allow for the addition of new family members and deletion of former ones.","Yes, day care treatment is covered under this policy, but for cataract treatment, there's a limit of Rs. 40,000 per eye, and coverage begins after a waiting period as specified in your policy. For non-network hospitals, you'll need to pay upfront and submit your claim to the TPA within 15 days of discharge. Required documents for reimbursement include a medical certificate, discharge certificate, investigation reports, prescriptions, indoor case papers (if applicable), and other specific documents, including a FIR copy if the illness is due to an accident.","Yes, your baby is covered from Day 1 within the family's sum insured. Also, pre- and postnatal expenses up to 5,000 are covered within the maternity limit, but only on an inpatient (IPD) basis. Keep in mind, though, that the policy does not cover expenses related to external congenital anomalies or defects.","No, a discharge summary certified only by a registered clinical psychologist may not be sufficient for a claim, as the policy specifies the Mental Healthcare Professional must meet certain criteria. Also, remember that you need to submit all claim documents to the TPA within the specified time limit, and bills should be in the insured person's name for reimbursement.","Yes, sterilized gloves are payable, but unsterilized ones aren't. ECG electrodes are payable up to 5 for each OT or ICU visit, with at least one set payable every other day for longer ICU stays. Whether oral chemotherapy is covered depends on the specific policy and its sub-limits, and it may be covered if it's part of day care treatment in a hospital.","Yes, your policy covers the costs of investigative tests or diagnostic procedures like radiology, pathology tests, X-rays, MRI, CT scans, and physiotherapy, as long as they're directly related to the injury or illness for which you're hospitalized. You can also claim both pre- and post-hospitalization medical expenses, provided they're for the same condition as the hospitalization and the inpatient claim is admissible. Just remember to claim your post-hospitalization expenses within 15 days of completing treatment.","Yes, children above 18 are covered up to age 26 as long as they're unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. However, coverage likely ceases when they turn 27. Coverage also ends if the policyholder stops paying premiums, the policy terminates, the insured person dies, a dependent is no longer considered a dependent, or the insured person is no longer a member of the group or an employee of the policyholder. Employees who leave the company due to resignation, retirement, or termination, along with their dependents, will be deleted from the policy, effective from their departure date or the last day of the month, depending on the insured's option.","Yes, specialist fees are covered under the In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses Cover if they are incurred on the written advice of a medical practitioner and are for medically necessary treatment. Also, keep in mind that if you're admitted to a room with rates exceeding your policy limits, the reimbursement of medical expenses will be proportional to the admissible room rate, unless the hospital doesn't differentiate billing based on room category, and expenses for primarily diagnostic purposes are excluded.","Yes, United India Insurance aims to settle claims within 15 days of receiving all required documents; however, if an investigation is needed, they have 45 days. If they exceed the 45-day period, they will pay interest at a rate of 2% above the bank rate. If your claim is rejected, you have 15 days to request a reconsideration, and the company will provide written reasons for the rejection within 15 days of receiving the final documents or investigation report. For grievances, you can contact United India Insurance through their website (www.uiic.co.in), toll-free number (1800 425 333 33), email (customercare@uiic.co.in), or by sending a courier to their Customer Care Department at their head office in Chennai, or by approaching the grievance cell at any of their branches.","Yes, the claim is eligible because the scenario falls under the definition of \"Day Care Treatment.\" This includes medical treatment or surgical procedures under anesthesia in a hospital or day care center for less than 24 hours, thanks to technological advancements that now allow procedures to be done on an outpatient basis that previously required longer hospital stays.","Yes, a hospital in a town with under 10,00,000 people needs to have qualified nurses on staff 24/7, at least 10 in-patient beds, qualified doctors in charge at all times, a fully equipped operation theatre, and maintain daily patient records accessible to the insurance company.","Yes, newly appointed employees and their dependents, along with newly wedded spouses, can be added during the policy period, provided the application is accepted, the additional premium is paid, and an endorsement confirming the addition is issued. Employee's siblings are covered up to age 26 if unmarried/unemployed and dependent, but changes to this are only accepted at renewal. No changes regarding relationships are accepted during the policy period.","Yes, robotic surgeries for other diseases are covered up to the limit specified in your policy. Also, the policy doesn't differentiate coverage or sub-limits based on whether the robotic surgery is a day care procedure or requires inpatient hospitalization.","Emergency medical evacuations require pre-authorization from the insurance provider; you must notify them immediately via their call center or in writing, so their specialists, along with the emergency assistance service, can determine the medical necessity for approval. When assessing claims, the policy follows a specific order, including applying proportionate clauses, co-pays, limits, and deductibles. Claim rejections are communicated in writing within 15 days, with a clear explanation of the reasons for rejection.","Yes, if you've maintained continuous health insurance coverage as per IRDAI portability rules, the waiting period for specific illnesses like knee replacement will be reduced based on your previous coverage. This reduction applies even if the condition developed after your policy began or was disclosed and accepted without a specific exclusion. So, you'll get credit for the waiting period you've already served under your old policy.","Whether expenses for imported medication not normally used in India are covered depends on whether the \"Medically Necessary Treatment\" conforms to professional standards widely accepted in international medical practice or by the medical community in India. \"Medical necessity\" also comes into play for things like refractive error correction, ultra-modern treatments, surgical appliances, and cosmetic surgery, often requiring certification or a specialist's prescription. So, for cosmetic or plastic surgery to be considered a medical necessity, the attending Medical Practitioner has to certify it.","Yes, in employer-employee groups, if an employee passes away, their dependents can continue to be covered until the policy expires, if the insured chooses. Also, for non-employer-employee groups, the policy schedule specifies the terms for removing a member. Moreover, for specific groups, additions via Certificates of Insurance are valid until the end of the policy period, starting from the actual date they were added to the policy, if requested.","Yes, original invoices with payment receipts and implant stickers are required for claim reimbursement, especially for surgeries like cataract or angioplasty involving implants. Specifically, you'll need lens stickers and invoices for cataract surgery, and stent invoices and stickers for angioplasty surgery. Without the implant sticker on the invoice, your claim could be rejected or delayed because it's a mandatory document. Make sure to submit all required documentation within the specified time limit.","I understand you're asking about coverage for a spouse who has suffered a serious accident. While the documents don't mention a specific accident case, it does state that treatment expenses won't be excluded for accident-related claims. Also, home nursing charges are payable after hospitalization if your spouse is incapacitated and requires prolonged care; just be sure to provide bills from a registered nursing service.","Yes, in a multi-policy situation, if the primary insurer's coverage isn't enough to cover the admissible claim, they'll coordinate with other insurers to settle the remaining amount, assuming the insured person submits a written request. The settlement will then follow the policy conditions.","Diagnostic tests are covered if they're directly related to the injury or illness for which you're hospitalized, including things like radiology, pathology tests, X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, and physiotherapy. However, the policy excludes expenses for admissions primarily for diagnostics and evaluation only, and any diagnostic expenses not related or incidental to the current diagnosis and treatment are also excluded. Also keep in mind that the policy has other exclusions like those for pre-existing conditions, certain waiting periods, and rest cure or rehabilitation.","Yes, in the event of the policyholder's death, the insurance company will pay the nominee named in the policy schedule. If there's no valid nominee at that time, the payment will instead be made to the policyholder's legal heirs or representatives. Once they receive the payment, it's considered a full settlement of the company's responsibility under the policy.","Yes, health insurance policies generally cover surgical and medical appliances as part of inpatient hospitalization expenses, specifically artificial limbs, prostheses, or devices needed for surgery or post-operative treatment. However, the cost of implants/medical devices are excluded from associated medical expenses where proportionate deduction is applicable. Keep in mind that policies often have exclusions and waiting periods for pre-existing conditions, specific treatments like cataract or knee replacement surgery, diagnostics, rest cures, rehabilitation, certain mental disorders and other specific surgeries.","No, expenses for AYUSH Day Care Centres will likely not be reimbursed unless the centre is registered with local authorities. The centre also needs to have qualified, registered AYUSH Medical Practitioners and maintain accessible patient records to be eligible for reimbursement. Registration with local authorities is a must-have.","Yes, to initiate cashless treatment, the insured person needs to present their TPA-issued ID card at the hospital insurance desk and fill out a cashless request form, submitting it to the TPA for pre-authorization; after verification, the TPA will issue a pre-authorization letter to the hospital. If the diagnosis, treatment plan, or costs change during hospitalization, the network provider must get a new authorization letter from the insurer. Also, remember that the treatment must occur within 15 days of the pre-authorization date at a network provider, and the pre-authorization is valid only if the details match the actual treatment received.","The pre-hospitalization medical expenses cover claim will only be processed after a decision has been made on your main hospitalization claim. This is because the policy requires the main hospitalization claim to be assessed first, and the pre-hospitalization claim's outcome depends on that assessment.","The policy provides several ways for the insured person to contact the company in case of any grievance, including via website (www.uiic.co.in), toll-free number (1800 425 333 33), email (customercare@uiic.co.in), or courier to the Customer Care Department in Chennai. The policyholder can also approach the grievance cell at any of the Company's branches.","Based on the provided policy document, automatically approving all claims is not possible. The document outlines a claim assessment process, including potential investigations and settlement timelines, indicating that each claim is subject to review and approval based on its merits and policy conditions.","The context does not explicitly state the verdict for a claim with missing or forged documents. However, it does mention that the policy shall be void and all premium paid thereon shall be forfeited to the Company in the event of misrepresentation, misdescription or non-disclosure of any material fact by the policyholder. It also states that the company can reject a claim if they decide to do so and will communicate the grounds for rejection in writing.","No, the company is not liable to make any reimbursements of Medical Expenses or pay any other amounts not specified in the Policy. However, claims for Pre and Post-Hospitalisation will be settled on a reimbursement basis on production of cash receipts along with supporting documents.","Not relevant to the context. The provided documents detail claim procedures, admissible medical expenses, and timelines for document submission within the context of a specific insurance policy. It does not contain information about medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide.","The policy explicitly states that any fraudulent claim will result in forfeiture of benefits and premium, and any amounts already paid must be repaid.

 | Response: {"answers":["No, expenses for at-home arthritis treatment would not be covered because the policy specifically excludes arthritis under the domiciliary hospitalization cover. The policy clearly states that claims will not be paid for arthritis, gout, and rheumatism under that particular cover.","Yes, the policy covers the cost of prosthetic devices and surgical appliances, defining these as artificial limbs or devices needed in connection with surgery or as a necessary part of the treatment immediately following surgery. Additionally, a Lumbo Sacral Belt and Abdominal Binder are payable for individuals who have undergone lumbar spine surgery. The policy also covers private nurse charges, specifically special nursing charges, during the post-hospitalization period.","Yes, this policy includes coverage for adult children and certain dental procedures. Children above 18 years are covered up to age 26 if they are unmarried, unemployed, and dependent, but coverage ends if the policyholder stops paying premiums or ceases to be a group member. Dental surgery required due to an accident with a minimum of 24 hours of hospitalization is covered, provided the necessary documents are submitted. However, general dental treatment or surgery is excluded unless it's due to an illness/injury not otherwise excluded or caused by an accident.","Yes, Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) is covered up to the limit specified in your Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period; this applies to Robotic Surgeries for other diseases and Stereotactic Radio Surgeries. ICU charges are covered up to the category/limit specified in the Policy Schedule/ Certificate of Insurance or actual expenses incurred, whichever is less, while modern treatments as per IRDAI shall be restricted to 50% of the Sum Insured. Remember that all limits mentioned in the Policy Schedule/Certificate of Insurance are applicable for each policy period of coverage.","Yes, a newly adopted child can be added to the policy as an insured person if the application is accepted, the additional premium is paid, and an endorsement confirming the addition is issued; the policyholder must notify the company of membership changes by the end of the following month. For employer-employee groups, newly appointed employees, newly wedded spouses, and newborn children can be added, while employees who leave can be deleted, and dependents can continue coverage in the event of the employee's death. However, the insurer may refuse cover for a child who isn't between 91 days and 18 years old (unless they're covered up to age 26 as dependent children), and for newborns to be covered from birth, the mother must be covered with maternity cover, and timely notification and premium payment are required.","Yes, day care treatment is covered under this policy, but for cataract surgery, the coverage is limited to Rs. 40,000 per eye. For inpatient care received at a non-network hospital, you'll need to pay upfront and then submit the necessary documents to the TPA within the prescribed time limit for reimbursement; claims must be submitted within 15 days of discharge. Document requirements for reimbursement claims under optional covers include a medical certificate confirming the diagnosis of critical illness, a discharge certificate/card from the hospital, investigation test reports confirming the diagnosis, first consultation letter and subsequent prescriptions, indoor case papers (if applicable), specific documents listed under the respective critical illness, and any other documents as may be required, including a copy of the FIR or medico-legal certificate if the critical illness arose from an accident.","Yes, the baby is covered from Day 1 within the family's sum insured. The policy also covers pre- and post-natal expenses to a limit of Rs 5000 within the maternity limit, but only on an IPD basis. However, it's not entirely clear if newborn intensive care is specifically covered, as there are maternity-related exclusions, so you'll need further clarification to determine claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses.","Okay, here's the information you need. Claim documents must be submitted to the TPA within the prescribed time limit, and for reimbursement claims in non-network hospitals, you'll need to pay upfront and submit the necessary documents. While a clinical psychologist is considered a mental healthcare professional, a discharge summary certified only by them might not be sufficient for a claim, as the policy may require additional documentation depending on the situation. Also, make sure the bills and medical documents are in the insured person's name.","Okay, heres the information I found. Sterilized gloves are payable, but unsterilized ones aren't. ECG electrodes are payable too, up to 5 for each case visiting the OT or ICU, and if the ICU stay is longer, at least one set is payable every other day. I also have information about items to be subsumed into room charges, procedure charges, and costs of treatment. However, I don't have any information about whether oral chemotherapy received in a network hospital is covered.","Yes, the policy covers the costs of investigative tests or diagnostic procedures like radiology, pathology tests, X-rays, MRI, CT scans, and physiotherapy if they are directly related to the injury or illness for which you were hospitalized. You can claim reimbursement for post-hospitalization expenses within 15 days from completing post-hospitalization treatment. Both pre-hospitalization and post-hospitalization medical expenses are claimable, with pre-hospitalization covered for 30 days and post-hospitalization covered for 15 days from completion of treatment, provided they relate to the same condition that required hospitalization and the inpatient claim is approved.","Yes, children over 18 can be covered up to age 26 if they're unmarried, unemployed, and dependent, but coverage likely stops when they turn 27. Also, coverage ends if the policyholder stops paying premiums, the policy terminates, the insured person dies, a dependent is no longer considered a dependent, or the insured person is no longer a member of the group. Finally, if it's an employer-employee group, an employee and their dependents will be removed from the policy when the employee resigns, retires, or is terminated, effective from that date or the end of that month, depending on the insured's preference.","Yes, specialist fees are covered under In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses, meaning the fees charged by medical practitioners, surgeons, specialists, and anaesthetists will be reimbursed if they are incurred on the written medical advice of a medical practitioner and are for medically necessary treatment. Also, if you opt for a room exceeding the limit specified in your policy, the reimbursement of medical expenses will be proportionate to the admissible rate per day compared to the actual room rate, unless the hospital doesn't follow differential billing based on room category. Note that expenses for admissions primarily for diagnostics and evaluation are excluded.","Yes, the document covers claim settlement timelines, rejection reconsideration, and grievance procedures. Claims must be settled or rejected within 15 days of receiving the last necessary document, or up to 45 days if an investigation is needed, with interest payable for delays. If a claim is rejected, you have 15 days to request reconsideration, and the company must provide written grounds for rejection within 15 days. For grievances, you can contact the company via their website, toll-free number, email, or courier, and if still unsatisfied, you can contact the grievance officer, the Insurance Ombudsman, or lodge a complaint at the IRDAI Integrated Grievance Management System.","Yes, the claim is likely eligible because the scenario fits the definition of \"Day Care Treatment.\" This includes medical or surgical procedures performed under anesthesia in a hospital or day care center for less than 24 hours, thanks to technological advancements that have shortened recovery times compared to what was previously required.","Yes, the requirements for hospitals to be empanelled for cashless mediclaim in towns with a population less than 10,00,000 include having qualified nursing staff on duty 24/7, a minimum of 10 in-patient beds, qualified medical practitioners in charge around the clock, a fully equipped operation theatre, and the maintenance of daily patient records accessible to the insurance company's authorized personnel. There is no information about differences in metropolitan areas provided.","Yes, newly appointed employees and their dependents, as well as newly wedded spouses of employees, can be added to the policy during the policy period, provided the application is accepted, the additional premium is paid, and an endorsement confirming the addition is issued. Employee/member's siblings are covered up to age 26 if unmarried/unemployed and dependent, as specified in the Policy Schedule/Certificate of Insurance, but no changes to these relationships are accepted during the policy period.","Yes, the policy covers expenses for robotic surgeries, including those for other diseases, up to the limit specified in your Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. It's important to note that the coverage and limits are the same whether the robotic surgery is performed as a day care procedure or during inpatient hospitalization; there are no separate sub-limits based on the setting.","Yes, emergency medical evacuations require pre-authorization; you must immediately notify the insurer via their call center or in writing so their specialists, along with the assistance service provider, can determine the medical necessity of the evacuation or repatriation before approval. When assessing claims, the policy uses proportionate clauses, co-pays, limits/sub-limits, and any chosen deductible. For benefit plans, fixed amounts are paid as specified in the policy schedule. If a claim is rejected, the company will communicate the reasons in writing within 15 days of receiving the final documents.","Yes, if you've maintained continuous health insurance coverage without any breaks as per IRDAI's portability rules, the waiting period for specific conditions like knee replacement will be reduced. The reduction will be equivalent to the time you were covered under your previous policy. This holds true even if the condition developed after your policy began, or if it was disclosed and accepted without a specific exclusion.","Coverage for unproven or experimental treatments or imported medications depends on whether they're considered \"Medically Necessary Treatment,\" meaning they conform to professional standards widely accepted internationally or in India. Medical necessity also plays a role in other areas; for example, refractive error correction needs a specialist's prescription specifying the necessity, and emergency evacuations require pre-authorization and a determination of medical necessity by specialists.","In employer-employee groups, if an employee dies, their dependents can continue to be covered until the policy expires, provided the insured opts for it. Additionally, for certain groups, any additions to the policy via Certificates of Insurance remain valid until the end of the policy period, starting from when they were added. For non-employer-employee groups, the handling of dependents' coverage after a member's death will be detailed in the Policy Schedule.","Yes, original invoices with payment receipts and implant stickers for all implants used during surgeries are required to support your claim, and this documentation must be submitted within the prescribed time limit. This includes surgeries like cataract surgery (lens sticker and invoice) and angioplasty surgery (stent invoice and sticker). If you don't have an implant sticker, it could lead to rejection or delay of the claim.","Home nursing charges are payable after hospitalization, and to claim them, you'll need to provide bills from a registered nursing service provider.","In a situation where you have multiple insurance policies, if your primary insurer doesn't fully cover an admissible claim, they'll reach out to other insurers to settle the remaining balance, as long as you submit a written request. The insurer of the policy you choose will be considered the primary insurer.","Diagnostic tests like radiology, pathology tests, X-rays, MRI, and CT scans are covered if they're directly related to the injury or illness for which you're hospitalized. However, expenses solely for diagnostics and evaluation, or those not related or incidental to your current diagnosis and treatment, are excluded. Also remember that the policy has exclusions for pre-existing conditions and waiting periods for specific conditions.","In the event of the policyholder's death, the company will pay the nominee named in the policy schedule. If there's no valid nominee at that time, the payment will be made to the policyholder's legal heirs or representatives, which releases the company from further liability. While the document doesn't specifically discuss updating the nominee after a previous nominee's death, it implies that with no nominee in place, the payment goes to the legal heirs. Any change of nomination has to be communicated to the Company in writing and is only effective once it's officially added to the policy.","Yes, a Surgical Appliance and/or Medical Appliance is defined as an artificial limb, prosthesis, or device needed for or related to surgery; a device or prosthesis necessary after surgery while medically required; or a medically necessary prosthesis or appliance for short-term recuperation. Medical appliances are covered under In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses, including artificial limbs and prosthetic devices implanted during surgery, like pacemakers and stents. However, keep in mind that the policy includes exclusions like pre-existing diseases, waiting periods for specific conditions, and certain expenses for diagnostics or treatments within an initial waiting period.","No, your expenses will likely not be reimbursed. The policy requires an AYUSH Day Care Centre to be registered with local authorities for expenses to be eligible for reimbursement. Even if the hospital has qualified practitioners, the lack of local registration means it doesn't meet the policy requirements.","Yes, to initiate cashless treatment, the insured person needs to show their TPA-issued ID card at the hospital insurance desk, fill out the cashless request form, and submit it to the TPA for pre-authorization, which the TPA will verify before issuing a pre-authorization letter to the hospital. If the diagnosis, treatment plan, or cost changes during hospitalization, the network provider must obtain a new pre-authorization letter from the insurer to keep the cashless facility valid.","Yes, the pre-hospitalization medical expenses claim will only be processed after a decision has been made on the main hospitalization claim. This is because the policy requires the main hospitalization claim to be assessed first, and the pre-hospitalization claim's approval depends on the outcome of that initial assessment.","The policy provides contact information for the company, United India Insurance Co. Ltd., including their website (www.uiic.co.in), toll-free number (1800 425 333 33), email (customercare@uiic.co.in), and mailing address (Customer Care Department, Head Office, 24, Whites Road, Chennai, Tamil Nadu- 600014). It also mentions contacting the grievance officer at customercare@uiic.co.in or the Insurance Ombudsman.","Based on the provided policy document, automatically approving all claims is not possible. The document outlines a claim assessment process, including potential investigations and settlement or rejection within a specified timeframe. The policy also addresses fraudulent claims, which would not be automatically approved.","The context does not explicitly state the verdict for a claim with missing or forged documents. However, it does mention that the policy shall be void and all premium paid thereon shall be forfeited to the Company in the event of misrepresentation, misdescription or non-disclosure of any material fact by the policyholder. It also mentions that the company can reject a claim if they decide to.","No, the company is not liable to make any reimbursements of Medical Expenses or pay any other amounts not specified in the Policy. However, claims for Pre and Post-Hospitalisation will be settled on a reimbursement basis on production of cash receipts along with supporting documents.","Not relevant to the context. The provided documents outline claim procedures, coverage details, and timelines for document submission within the context of a specific insurance policy. They do not contain a comprehensive list of medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide.","The policy explicitly states that any fraudulent claim will result in forfeiture of benefits and premium, and any amounts already paid must be repaid. The company may also take legal action against individuals who attempt to submit fraudulent claims."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 310449.74 ms

 | Response: {"answers":["No, the expenses would not be covered because the policy explicitly states that claims related to arthritis are not covered under the Domiciliary Hospitalisation Cover.","Yes, the policy covers the cost of prosthetic devices and surgical appliances, including artificial limbs/prosthesis or devices needed after surgery or during recuperation. Additionally, a Lumbo Sacral Belt and Abdominal Binder are covered for individuals who have undergone lumbar spine surgery, and private nurse charges are payable during post-hospitalization.","Yes, the policy has a few key points: unmarried, unemployed, and dependent children are covered with their parents up to age 26, but coverage ends if premiums aren't paid or if a dependent is no longer considered a dependent. Also, dental surgery due to an accident requiring at least 24 hours of hospitalization is covered, provided you submit the necessary documents like the claim form, medical reports, and FIR copy (if applicable) to the TPA within the given timeframe. However, general dental treatment, dentures, or surgeries are typically excluded unless related to a covered illness, injury, or accident.","Yes, your insurance policy covers Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) up to the limit specified in your Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period, and claims can be made as defined under Clause VI. 3 and 4. ICU charges are also covered, including expenses for the ICU bed, general medical support services, monitoring devices, critical care nursing, and intensivist charges. Keep in mind that modern treatments as per IRDAI are restricted to 50% of the Sum Insured, and there's a 50% co-pay for certain treatments like femato laser surgery, with all limits mentioned in the Policy Schedule applicable for each policy period.","Yes, a newly adopted child can be added to your health insurance policy during the policy period if the application is accepted, the additional premium is paid, and an endorsement confirming the addition is issued; remember to notify the insurance company about the change. Generally, insurers may refuse cover for children outside the 91 days to 18 years age range, unless they're covered with their parents up to age 26 and meet specific dependency criteria. Also, policies often include clauses for adding new employees, spouses, and newborns (or deleting members who leave the company), and in the event of an employee's death, their dependents may continue coverage until the policy expires.","Yes, day care treatment is covered under this policy, but for cataract surgery, there's a limit of Rs. 40,000 per eye. If you receive inpatient care at a non-network hospital, you'll need to pay upfront and then submit your claim for reimbursement to the TPA within 15 days of discharge. Make sure to include all necessary documents such as the medical certificate, discharge certificate, investigation reports, prescriptions, indoor case papers, and, if applicable, a copy of the FIR or medico-legal certificate if the illness resulted from an accident.","Yes, your baby is covered from day one under the family's sum insured. Additionally, pre- and post-natal expenses up to 5,000 are covered within the maternity limit, but only on an inpatient (IPD) basis. However, it's important to note that specific exclusions related to maternity may apply, and it's unclear if newborn intensive care is covered or excluded, particularly regarding congenital anomalies or other specific conditions. Therefore, further clarification is needed to determine full claim eligibility in specific situations.","Regarding inpatient psychiatric treatment claims, the provided documents don't detail specific requirements or if a general practitioner's prescription is acceptable. However, a discharge summary certified only by a registered clinical psychologist might not be sufficient unless they meet the policy's definition of a Mental Healthcare Professional. Remember that for reimbursement claims in non-network hospitals, you'll need to pay upfront and submit all required documents, including cash receipts for pre- and post-hospitalization, to the TPA within the specified timeframe.","Yes, expenses incurred on oral chemotherapy as an inpatient or as part of daycare treatment in a hospital are covered, subject to policy sub-limits. Sterilized gloves are payable, and up to 5 ECG electrodes are payable for each OT or ICU visit; for longer ICU stays, at least one set is payable every second day.","Yes, the policy covers the cost of investigative tests or diagnostic procedures, like radiology, pathology tests, X-rays, MRI and CT scans, and physiotherapy, if they're directly related to the injury or illness that led to hospitalization. You can also claim both pre- and post-hospitalization expenses, as long as they're for the same condition that required you to be admitted. Just make sure to claim your post-hospitalization expenses within 15 days of finishing treatment and remember that pre-hospitalization expenses are covered for a predefined period before your admission, such as the 18 days in your case.","Yes, children above 18 can be covered up to age 26 if they're unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. Coverage ends if premiums aren't paid, the policy terminates, the insured person dies, a dependent ceases to be a dependent (unless otherwise agreed for continuation until the policy's end), or the insured person is no longer a group member/employee; deletion from the policy also occurs upon resignation, retirement, termination, or death.","Yes, specialist fees are covered under In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses, including fees from Medical Practitioners, Surgeons, Specialists, and Anaesthetists, as long as the expenses are medically necessary and based on written advice from a Medical Practitioner. Also, if a patient is admitted to a room with rates exceeding policy limits, reimbursement will be proportional to the ratio of the admissible room rate to the actual room rate, except for hospitals without differential billing or expenses where differential billing isn't based on room category.","Yes, the company aims to settle claims, including rejections, within 15 days of receiving all required documents; however, if an investigation is needed, they have up to 45 days. If your claim is rejected, you have 15 days to request a reconsideration, and the company will provide a written explanation for the rejection within 15 days of receiving the final documents or investigation report. Also, if you have any grievances, you can contact the company through their website, toll-free number, email, or by visiting a branch, and if you're still not satisfied, you can contact the grievance officer or the Insurance Ombudsman.","Yes, the claim is eligible because it falls under the \"Day Care Treatment\" definition. This includes medical treatments or surgeries done under anesthesia in a hospital or day care center, lasting less than 24 hours, thanks to advancements that avoid longer hospital stays.","Yes, for hospitals in towns with populations less than 10,00,000, the requirements include having qualified nursing staff on duty 24/7, a minimum of 10 in-patient beds, qualified medical practitioners in charge around the clock, a fully equipped operation theatre, and the maintenance of daily patient records accessible to the insurance company. Information regarding metropolitan areas was not found.","Yes, newly appointed employees and their dependents, as well as newly wedded spouses of employees, can be added during the policy period, assuming the application is accepted, the premium is paid, and an endorsement is issued. However, while employee/member's siblings are covered up to age 26 if unmarried/unemployed and dependent, no changes to this are accepted during the policy period, though a change can be requested at renewal.","Yes, the policy covers expenses for robotic surgeries, including those for other diseases, up to the limit specified in your Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. The coverage applies to both day care procedures and inpatient hospitalization, without any different sub-limits or conditions based on the setting. So, you can rest assured that robotic surgeries are covered under the policy.","Emergency medical evacuations require pre-authorization, so you'll need to contact the insurer immediately through their call center or in writing. Their specialists, along with the emergency assistance service, will determine if the evacuation or repatriation is medically necessary before approving it. When assessing claims, the policy applies the proportionate clause, co-pay, limits/sub-limits on medical expenses, and your chosen deductible in that order. Keep in mind that the company isn't liable for reimbursements of medical expenses or amounts not specified in the policy.","Yes, if you've maintained continuous health insurance coverage without any breaks as defined by IRDAI portability rules, the waiting period for specific illnesses, such as needing a knee replacement, will be reduced based on your previous coverage. This reduction applies even if the condition developed after your policy was issued or was declared and accepted without a specific exclusion.","The provided information doesn't include specific clauses about unproven or experimental treatments or imported medications. However, for coverage, any treatment, including an imported medication not normally used in India, would need to meet the policy's definition of \"Medically Necessary Treatment,\" conforming to international or Indian medical standards. Also, keep in mind that \"medical necessity\" is specifically important for things like refractive error correction (requiring a specialist's prescription) and cosmetic surgery (requiring certification from the attending doctor).","Yes, in employer-employee group policies, if an employee dies, their dependents can continue to be covered until the policy expires, provided the insured chooses this option. For non-employer-employee groups, whether dependents can continue coverage after the employee's death depends on the specific terms outlined in the Policy Schedule. Additionally, for certain groups, any additions to the policy through Certificates of Insurance remain valid until the end of the Policy Period, starting from when they were added to the policy.","Yes, to support claims involving implanted devices, you'll need to submit original invoices with payment receipts and the implant stickers for all implants used during the surgery. For example, in cataract surgery, that would include the lens sticker and invoice, and for angioplasty, the stent invoice and sticker. Providing just a generic invoice without the implant sticker could lead to claim rejection or partial settlement, as the policy requires this documentation to validate the claim and ensure proper processing.","Yes, if your spouse is covered under the policy, a serious accident may be covered, as claims arising from accidents don't have specific waiting periods. Also, if your spouse requires home nursing after being discharged from the hospital due to being incapacitated, the policy covers those charges, provided you have bills from a registered nursing service.","In a situation where multiple insurance policies exist and the primary insurer's coverage is insufficient to cover the admissible claim, the primary insurer will reach out to other insurers to coordinate payment of the remaining balance. However, this coordination and settlement, which will be as per the policy conditions, only occurs if the insured person submits a written request.","No, expenses related to admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded, as are diagnostic expenses not related or incidental to current diagnosis and treatment. The policy also has exclusions for pre-existing diseases, waiting periods for certain conditions, rest cure, rehabilitation, and standard permanent exclusions. Information about specific claim eligibility for negative imaging or other tests is not available in the provided context. The context includes policy details, names, and dates seemingly related to insurance policies, but doesn't relate to the question \"All tests\".","Yes, in the event of the policyholder's death, the company will pay the nominee as named in the policy schedule. If there's no valid nominee, the payment goes to the policyholder's legal heirs or representatives, and their discharge will fully release the company from liability. Remember that any nomination changes must be communicated in writing to the company and endorsed on the policy to be effective.","Yes, the policy covers surgical and medical appliances as part of In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses, including artificial limbs and prosthetic devices necessary for treatment following surgery, such as pacemakers and vascular stents, or those that are medically necessary for short-term recuperation. However, keep in mind that the policy has waiting periods for pre-existing conditions and specific treatments like knee replacements, and it excludes expenses for diagnostics, rest cures, and certain mental health treatments. A surgical/medical appliance is defined as an artificial limb, prosthesis or device which is required for the purpose of or in connection with a Surgery.","No, expenses will likely not be reimbursed. The policy states that AYUSH Day Care Centres must be registered with local authorities and comply with specific criteria, including having qualified registered AYUSH Medical Practitioners and maintaining accessible patient records. Registration with local authorities is a requirement for reimbursement.","Yes, to initiate the cashless claim process, the insured person needs to show their TPA-issued ID card at the hospital insurance desk and fill out the cashless request form, submitting it to the TPA for pre-authorization, which they will verify before issuing a pre-authorization letter to the hospital. It's important to remember that if there are any changes to the diagnosis, treatment plan, or costs during hospitalization, the network provider must get a new pre-authorization letter from the insurer to keep the cashless facility valid.","The Pre-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim will only be processed after a decision has been made on your main Hospitalisation claim. The policy is designed to assess claims in a step-by-step manner, meaning the pre-hospitalization claim's outcome relies on the main hospitalization claim's decision.","The policy provides contact information for the company, United India Insurance Co. Ltd., including their website (www.uiic.co.in), toll-free number (1800 425 333 33), email (customercare@uiic.co.in), and mailing address (Customer Care Department, Head Office, 24, Whites Road, Chennai, Tamil Nadu- 600014). It also mentions contacting the grievance officer at customercare@uiic.co.in and provides a link for updated details.","Based on the provided policy document, automatically approving all claims is not possible. The document outlines a claim assessment process, including potential investigations and settlement timelines, indicating that each claim is subject to review and approval based on its merits and policy conditions.","The context does not explicitly state the verdict for a claim with missing or forged documents. However, it does mention that the policy shall be void and all premium paid thereon shall be forfeited to the Company in the event of misrepresentation, misdescription or non-disclosure of any material fact by the policyholder. It also states that the company can reject a claim if they decide to, and will communicate the grounds for rejection in writing.","No, the policy states that pre- and post-hospitalization medical expenses are covered only if a claim for in-patient hospitalization has been accepted and the expenses are related to the same illness or injury. The company is not liable to make any reimbursements of Medical Expenses or pay any other amounts not specified in the Policy.","Not relevant to the context. The provided documents detail claim procedures, timelines for document submission, and specific inclusions/exclusions within the context of a particular insurance policy, but do not contain information about medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide.","The policy explicitly states that any fraudulent claim will result in forfeiture of benefits and premium, and any amounts already paid must be repaid. The company may also take legal action against individuals who commit fraud."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 52373.14 ms

Dental treatment is typically excluded unless it's needed because of an injury, but the Platinum plan does offer an OPD benefit covering dental and eye care, reimbursing up to Rs. 5,000 every three years.

No, coverage typically extends to unmarried and financially dependent siblings, but not specifically to siblings who are older and have experienced job loss.","I'm sorry, but I am unable to provide information on the maximum cashless hospitalization benefit for accidental trauma for a covered parent-in-law or the claim notification procedure. Also, I don't have any details about replacing a lost ID card for a dependent.","Yes, the policy covers hospitalization in a general hospital or nursing home for medically necessary treatment of illnesses, and psychiatric treatment in a \"mental health establishment\" which includes general hospitals, but not in a family residential place. The Platinum plan includes maternity expenses after a 24-month waiting period (limited to 2.5% of the Sum Insured), assisted reproduction treatment, donor expenses (up to the full Sum Insured if the insured is the recipient, or a lump sum of 10% of Sum Insured if the insured is the donor), a medical second opinion (up to Rs.25,000 per policy period) and air ambulance cover (10% of Sum Insured).

Newborns are covered from day one if the necessary premium is paid. As for changing the communication email for the primary insured, the provided document does not specify that process.","Yes, a claim can be submitted for prosthetic limb implantation following an accident. If your initial sum insured is used up, you can claim the remaining amount from another insurer of your choice, and the first insurer will coordinate with the others to settle the claim according to the policy conditions. Also, claims can be made under other group mediclaim policies for amounts not covered by another policy, even if the sum insured isn't exhausted. Remember that you must nominate someone when you start the policy, and you can change this nomination at any time by informing the company in writing so they can update the policy.","To file a claim, you'll need to submit the final claim form with original bills, cash memos, and reports, along with the original hospital discharge certificate/card.

  } | Response: {"answers":["No, the expenses would not be covered. The policy explicitly excludes claims related to arthritis under the Domiciliary Hospitalisation Cover. This exclusion applies regardless of medical necessity or the unavailability of hospital beds.","Yes, the policy covers expenses for prosthetic devices and surgical appliances, defining them as artificial limbs or devices needed in connection with surgery or as a necessary part of post-surgery treatment, as long as they are medically necessary. Additionally, a Lumbo Sacral Belt and Abdominal Binder are payable for individuals who have undergone lumbar spine surgery. The policy also covers private nurse charges, specifically special nursing charges, during the post-hospitalization period.","Yes, the claim is admissible for dental surgery required due to an accident that necessitates at least 24 hours of hospitalization; you'll need to submit the claim form, medical reports, and an FIR copy if applicable. Keep in mind that generally, dental treatment, dentures, or surgery are excluded unless they are needed for treating an illness/injury not excluded in the policy or are due to an accident. Also, children over 18 are covered with parents until age 26 if they are unmarried, unemployed, and dependent, but coverage ends if they cease to be dependents.","Yes, Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) is covered up to the limit specified in your Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period, specifically for claims involving IONM related to Robotic Surgeries for other diseases and Stereotactic Radio Surgeries. Also, keep in mind that all limits mentioned in the Policy Schedule/Certificate of Insurance apply for each policy period of coverage. As a note, ICU charges cover expenses like the ICU bed, monitoring devices, critical care nursing, and intensivist charges, but modern treatments as per IRDAI will be restricted to 50% of the Sum Insured.","The newly-adopted child may be added as an Insured Person during the policy period if the application is accepted, additional pro-rata premium is paid, and an endorsement is issued. The insurer may refuse cover if material information is not disclosed.","For the day care cataract procedure, claims should be notified and supported with documents like a completed claim form, photo ID, age proof, health card, policy copy, medical certificates, test reports, and bills. For inpatient care at a non-network hospital, similar documentation is required, with claims settled on a reimbursement basis. Both claims must be submitted within the prescribed time limits.","I don't have enough information to determine the claim eligibility for the newborn's treatment expenses, as the context provided does not specify terms related to newborn cover or specific exclusions applicable to such cases.","A prescription from a general practitioner and a discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist are sufficient if the Clinical Psychologist meets the qualifications recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India. The prescription must be from a valid Medical Practitioner.","ECG electrodes are admissible, with up to 5 electrodes required for each case visiting OT or ICU, and at least one set every second day for longer ICU stays. Gloves are not mentioned as payable.","Pre-hospitalisation expenses incurred 18 days before admission and post-hospitalisation expenses incurred 20 days after discharge can be claimed if they relate to the same illness and the in-patient hospitalisation claim is admissible.","Coverage for a dependent child who turns 27 during the policy period will end when they cease to be a dependent, unless specifically agreed otherwise for continuation until the end of the policy period.","Reimbursement for associated expenses will be in the same proportion as the admissible room rent rate to the actual room rent rate. The relevant clause is the Proportionate Clause, which applies when room rates exceed policy limits.","If a claim is partly rejected due to lack of documentation and the insured resubmits after 10 days, they can contest a final rejection by representing to the insurer for reconsideration within 15 days from the receipt of the claims decision.","Yes, the claim is eligible. The procedure falls under \"Day Care Treatment,\" which covers surgeries or procedures requiring less than 24 hours of hospitalization due to technological advances, provided they are listed in the policy's day care procedures.","The hospital must have at least 10 in-patient beds in towns with less than 1 million population, while in metropolitan areas, it must have at least 15 in-patient beds. Other requirements remain the same across locations.","To add a new employee and their spouse mid-policy, the employer must apply for coverage, pay additional premium on a pro-rata basis, and receive an endorsement confirming their addition. The sibling can be covered if unmarried, unemployed, and dependent, up to age 26.","Yes, the policy covers robotic surgery expenses, even for other diseases, up to the limit specified in your Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. It doesn't appear that there are different sub-limits or coverage conditions depending on whether the robotic surgery is performed as a day care procedure versus inpatient hospitalization.","Yes, emergency medical evacuations require pre-authorization, so you must immediately notify the insurer via their call center or in writing, allowing their specialists, with assistance from the service provider, to determine the medical necessity before approval. When assessing claims, the policy follows a specific order, including application of proportionate clause, co-pay, limits/sub-limits, and any chosen deductible. For benefit plans, fixed amounts are paid as specified, and claim rejections are communicated in writing within 15 days, clearly stating the reason.","Yes, if you've maintained continuous health insurance coverage without any breaks as defined by IRDAI portability rules, the waiting period for specific illnesses, such as needing a knee replacement, will be reduced based on your previous coverage. This reduction applies even if the condition developed after your policy was issued or was declared and accepted without a specific exclusion.","The provided information doesn't include specific clauses about unproven or experimental treatments or imported medications. However, for coverage, any treatment, including an imported medication not normally used in India, would need to meet the policy's definition of \"Medically Necessary Treatment,\" conforming to international or Indian medical standards. Also, keep in mind that \"medical necessity\" is specifically important for things like refractive error correction (requiring a specialist's prescription) and cosmetic surgery (requiring certification from the attending doctor).","Yes, in employer-employee group policies, if an employee dies, their dependents can continue to be covered until the policy expires, provided the insured chooses this option. For non-employer-employee groups, whether dependents can continue coverage after the employee's death depends on the specific terms outlined in the Policy Schedule. Additionally, for certain groups, any additions to the policy through Certificates of Insurance remain valid until the end of the Policy Period, starting from when they were added to the policy.","Yes, to support claims involving implanted devices, you'll need to submit original invoices with payment receipts and the implant stickers for all implants used during the surgery. For example, in cataract surgery, that would include the lens sticker and invoice, and for angioplasty, the stent invoice and sticker. Providing just a generic invoice without the implant sticker could lead to claim rejection or partial settlement, as the policy requires this documentation to validate the claim and ensure proper processing.","Yes, if your spouse is covered under the policy, a serious accident may be covered, as claims arising from accidents don't have specific waiting periods. Also, if your spouse requires home nursing after being discharged from the hospital due to being incapacitated, the policy covers those charges, provided you have bills from a registered nursing service.","In a situation where multiple insurance policies exist and the primary insurer's coverage is insufficient to cover the admissible claim, the primary insurer will reach out to other insurers to coordinate payment of the remaining balance. However, this coordination and settlement, which will be as per the policy conditions, only occurs if the insured person submits a written request.","No, expenses related to admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded, as are diagnostic expenses not related or incidental to current diagnosis and treatment. The policy also has exclusions for pre-existing diseases, waiting periods for certain conditions, rest cure, rehabilitation, and standard permanent exclusions. Information about specific claim eligibility for negative imaging or other tests is not available in the provided context. The context includes policy details, names, and dates seemingly related to insurance policies, but doesn't relate to the question \"All tests\".","Yes, in the event of the policyholder's death, the company will pay the nominee as named in the policy schedule. If there's no valid nominee, the payment goes to the policyholder's legal heirs or representatives, and their discharge will fully release the company from liability. Remember that any nomination changes must be communicated in writing to the company and endorsed on the policy to be effective.","Yes, the policy covers surgical and medical appliances as part of In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses, including artificial limbs and prosthetic devices necessary for treatment following surgery, such as pacemakers and vascular stents, or those that are medically necessary for short-term recuperation. However, keep in mind that the policy has waiting periods for pre-existing conditions and specific treatments like knee replacements, and it excludes expenses for diagnostics, rest cures, and certain mental health treatments. A surgical/medical appliance is defined as an artificial limb, prosthesis or device which is required for the purpose of or in connection with a Surgery.","No, expenses will likely not be reimbursed. The policy states that AYUSH Day Care Centres must be registered with local authorities and comply with specific criteria, including having qualified registered AYUSH Medical Practitioners and maintaining accessible patient records. Registration with local authorities is a requirement for reimbursement.","Yes, to initiate the cashless claim process, the insured person needs to show their TPA-issued ID card at the hospital insurance desk and fill out the cashless request form, submitting it to the TPA for pre-authorization, which they will verify before issuing a pre-authorization letter to the hospital. It's important to remember that if there are any changes to the diagnosis, treatment plan, or costs during hospitalization, the network provider must get a new pre-authorization letter from the insurer to keep the cashless facility valid.","The Pre-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim will only be processed after a decision has been made on your main Hospitalisation claim. The policy is designed to assess claims in a step-by-step manner, meaning the pre-hospitalization claim's outcome relies on the main hospitalization claim's decision.","The policy provides contact information for the company, United India Insurance Co. Ltd., including their website (www.uiic.co.in), toll-free number (1800 425 333 33), email (customercare@uiic.co.in), and mailing address (Customer Care Department, Head Office, 24, Whites Road, Chennai, Tamil Nadu- 600014). It also mentions contacting the grievance officer at customercare@uiic.co.in and provides a link for updated details.","Based on the provided policy document, automatically approving all claims is not possible. The document outlines a claim assessment process, including potential investigations and settlement timelines, indicating that each claim is subject to review and approval based on its merits and policy conditions.","The context does not explicitly state the verdict for a claim with missing or forged documents. However, it does mention that the policy shall be void and all premium paid thereon shall be forfeited to the Company in the event of misrepresentation, misdescription or non-disclosure of any material fact by the policyholder. It also states that the company can reject a claim if they decide to, and will communicate the grounds for rejection in writing.","No, the policy states that pre- and post-hospitalization medical expenses are covered only if a claim for in-patient hospitalization has been accepted and the expenses are related to the same illness or injury. The company is not liable to make any reimbursements of Medical Expenses or pay any other amounts not specified in the Policy.","Not relevant to the context. The provided documents detail claim procedures, timelines for document submission, and specific inclusions/exclusions within the context of a particular insurance policy, but do not contain information about medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide.","The policy explicitly states that any fraudulent claim will result in forfeiture of benefits and premium, and any amounts already paid must be repaid. The company may also take legal action against individuals who commit fraud."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 83203.2 ms

Additionally, a Lumbo Sacral Belt and Abdominal Binder are covered for individuals who have undergone lumbar spine surgery, and private nurse charges are payable during post-hospitalization.","Yes, the policy has a few key points: unmarried, unemployed, and dependent children are covered with their parents up to age 26, but coverage ends if premiums aren't paid or if a dependent is no longer considered a dependent. Also, dental surgery due to an accident requiring at least 24 hours of hospitalization is covered, provided you submit the necessary documents like the claim form, medical reports, and FIR copy (if applicable) to the TPA within the given timeframe.

Generally, insurers may refuse cover for children outside the 91 days to 18 years age range, unless they're covered with their parents up to age 26 and meet specific dependency criteria. Also, policies often include clauses for adding new employees, spouses, and newborns (or deleting members who leave the company), and in the event of an employee's death, their dependents may continue coverage until the policy expires.","Yes, day care treatment is covered under this policy, but for cataract surgery, there's a limit of Rs. 40,000 per eye. If you receive inpatient care at a non-network hospital, you'll need to pay upfront and then submit your claim for reimbursement to the TPA within 15 days of discharge. Make sure to include all necessary documents such as the medical certificate, discharge certificate, investigation reports, prescriptions, indoor case papers, and, if applicable, a copy of the FIR or medico-legal certificate if the illness resulted from an accident.","Yes, your baby is covered from day one under the family's sum insured. Additionally, pre- and post-natal expenses up to 5,000 are covered within the maternity limit, but only on an inpatient (IPD) basis. However, it's important to note that specific exclusions related to maternity may apply, and it's unclear if newborn intensive care is covered or excluded, particularly regarding congenital anomalies or other specific conditions. Therefore, further clarification is needed to determine full claim eligibility in specific situations.","Regarding inpatient psychiatric treatment claims, the provided documents don't detail specific requirements or if a general practitioner's prescription is acceptable. However, a discharge summary certified only by a registered clinical psychologist might not be sufficient unless they meet the policy's definition of a Mental Healthcare Professional. Remember that for reimbursement claims in non-network hospitals, you'll need to pay upfront and submit all required documents, including cash receipts for pre- and post-hospitalization, to the TPA within the specified timeframe.","Yes, expenses incurred on oral chemotherapy as an inpatient or as part of daycare treatment in a hospital are covered, subject to policy sub-limits. Sterilized gloves are payable, and up to 5 ECG electrodes are payable for each OT or ICU visit; for longer ICU stays, at least one set is payable every second day.","Yes, the policy covers the cost of investigative tests or diagnostic procedures, like radiology, pathology tests, X-rays, MRI and CT scans, and physiotherapy, if they're directly related to the injury or illness that led to hospitalization. You can also claim both pre- and post-hospitalization expenses, as long as they're for the same condition that required you to be admitted. Just make sure to claim your post-hospitalization expenses within 15 days of finishing treatment and remember that pre-hospitalization expenses are covered for a predefined period before your admission, such as the 18 days in your case.","Yes, children above 18 can be covered up to age 26 if they're unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. Coverage ends if premiums aren't paid, the policy terminates, the insured person dies, a dependent ceases to be a dependent (unless otherwise agreed for continuation until the policy's end), or the insured person is no longer a group member/employee; deletion from the policy also occurs upon resignation, retirement, termination, or death.","Yes, specialist fees are covered under In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses, including fees from Medical Practitioners, Surgeons, Specialists, and Anaesthetists, as long as the expenses are medically necessary and based on written advice from a Medical Practitioner. Also, if a patient is admitted to a room with rates exceeding policy limits, reimbursement will be proportional to the ratio of the admissible room rate to the actual room rate, except for hospitals without differential billing or expenses where differential billing isn't based on room category.","Yes, the company aims to settle claims, including rejections, within 15 days of receiving all required documents; however, if an investigation is needed, they have up to 45 days. If your claim is rejected, you have 15 days to request a reconsideration, and the company will provide a written explanation for the rejection within 15 days of receiving the final documents or investigation report. Also, if you have any grievances, you can contact the company through their website, toll-free number, email, or by visiting a branch, and if you're still not satisfied, you can contact the grievance officer or the Insurance Ombudsman.","Yes, the claim is eligible because it falls under the \"Day Care Treatment\" definition. This includes medical treatments or surgeries done under anesthesia in a hospital or day care center, lasting less than 24 hours, thanks to advancements that avoid longer hospital stays.","Yes, for hospitals in towns with populations less than 10,00,000, the requirements include having qualified nursing staff on duty 24/7, a minimum of 10 in-patient beds, qualified medical practitioners in charge around the clock, a fully equipped operation theatre, and the maintenance of daily patient records accessible to the insurance company. Information regarding metropolitan areas was not found.","Yes, newly appointed employees and their dependents, as well as newly wedded spouses of employees, can be added during the policy period, assuming the application is accepted, the premium is paid, and an endorsement is issued. However, while employee/member's siblings are covered up to age 26 if unmarried/unemployed and dependent, no changes to this are accepted during the policy period, though a change can be requested at renewal.","Yes, the policy covers expenses for robotic surgeries, including those for other diseases, up to the limit specified in your Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. The coverage applies to both day care procedures and inpatient hospitalization, without any different sub-limits or conditions based on the setting. So, you can rest assured that robotic surgeries are covered under the policy.","Emergency medical evacuations require pre-authorization, so you'll need to contact the insurer immediately through their call center or in writing. Their specialists, along with the emergency assistance service, will determine if the evacuation or repatriation is medically necessary before approving it. When assessing claims, the policy applies the proportionate clause, co-pay, limits/sub-limits on medical expenses, and your chosen deductible in that order. Keep in mind that the company isn't liable for reimbursements of medical expenses or amounts not specified in the policy.","Yes, if you've maintained continuous health insurance coverage without any breaks as defined by IRDAI portability rules, the waiting period for specific illnesses, such as needing a knee replacement, will be reduced based on your previous coverage. This reduction applies even if the condition developed after your policy was issued or was declared and accepted without a specific exclusion.","The provided information doesn't include specific clauses about unproven or experimental treatments or imported medications. However, for coverage, any treatment, including an imported medication not normally used in India, would need to meet the policy's definition of \"Medically Necessary Treatment,\" conforming to international or Indian medical standards. Also, keep in mind that \"medical necessity\" is specifically important for things like refractive error correction (requiring a specialist's prescription) and cosmetic surgery (requiring certification from the attending doctor).","Yes, in employer-employee group policies, if an employee dies, their dependents can continue to be covered until the policy expires, provided the insured chooses this option. For non-employer-employee groups, whether dependents can continue coverage after the employee's death depends on the specific terms outlined in the Policy Schedule. Additionally, for certain groups, any additions to the policy through Certificates of Insurance remain valid until the end of the Policy Period, starting from when they were added to the policy.","Yes, to support claims involving implanted devices, you'll need to submit original invoices with payment receipts and the implant stickers for all implants used during the surgery. For example, in cataract surgery, that would include the lens sticker and invoice, and for angioplasty, the stent invoice and sticker. Providing just a generic invoice without the implant sticker could lead to claim rejection or partial settlement, as the policy requires this documentation to validate the claim and ensure proper processing.","Yes, if your spouse is covered under the policy, a serious accident may be covered, as claims arising from accidents don't have specific waiting periods. Also, if your spouse requires home nursing after being discharged from the hospital due to being incapacitated, the policy covers those charges, provided you have bills from a registered nursing service.","In a situation where multiple insurance policies exist and the primary insurer's coverage is insufficient to cover the admissible claim, the primary insurer will reach out to other insurers to coordinate payment of the remaining balance. However, this coordination and settlement, which will be as per the policy conditions, only occurs if the insured person submits a written request.","No, expenses related to admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded, as are diagnostic expenses not related or incidental to current diagnosis and treatment. The policy also has exclusions for pre-existing diseases, waiting periods for certain conditions, rest cure, rehabilitation, and standard permanent exclusions. Information about specific claim eligibility for negative imaging or other tests is not available in the provided context. The context includes policy details, names, and dates seemingly related to insurance policies, but doesn't relate to the question \"All tests\".","Yes, in the event of the policyholder's death, the company will pay the nominee as named in the policy schedule. If there's no valid nominee, the payment goes to the policyholder's legal heirs or representatives, and their discharge will fully release the company from liability. Remember that any nomination changes must be communicated in writing to the company and endorsed on the policy to be effective.","Yes, the policy covers surgical and medical appliances as part of In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses, including artificial limbs and prosthetic devices necessary for treatment following surgery, such as pacemakers and vascular stents, or those that are medically necessary for short-term recuperation. However, keep in mind that the policy has waiting periods for pre-existing conditions and specific treatments like knee replacements, and it excludes expenses for diagnostics, rest cures, and certain mental health treatments. A surgical/medical appliance is defined as an artificial limb, prosthesis or device which is required for the purpose of or in connection with a Surgery.","No, expenses will likely not be reimbursed. The policy states that AYUSH Day Care Centres must be registered with local authorities and comply with specific criteria, including having qualified registered AYUSH Medical Practitioners and maintaining accessible patient records. Registration with local authorities is a requirement for reimbursement.","Yes, to initiate the cashless claim process, the insured person needs to show their TPA-issued ID card at the hospital insurance desk and fill out the cashless request form, submitting it to the TPA for pre-authorization, which they will verify before issuing a pre-authorization letter to the hospital. It's important to remember that if there are any changes to the diagnosis, treatment plan, or costs during hospitalization, the network provider must get a new pre-authorization letter from the insurer to keep the cashless facility valid.","The Pre-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim will only be processed after a decision has been made on your main Hospitalisation claim. The policy is designed to assess claims in a step-by-step manner, meaning the pre-hospitalization claim's outcome relies on the main hospitalization claim's decision.","The policy provides contact information for the company, United India Insurance Co. Ltd., including their website (www.uiic.co.in), toll-free number (1800 425 333 33), email (customercare@uiic.co.in), and mailing address (Customer Care Department, Head Office, 24, Whites Road, Chennai, Tamil Nadu- 600014). It also mentions contacting the grievance officer at customercare@uiic.co.in and provides a link for updated details.","Based on the provided policy document, automatically approving all claims is not possible. The document outlines a claim assessment process, including potential investigations and settlement timelines, indicating that each claim is subject to review and approval based on its merits and policy conditions.","The context does not explicitly state the verdict for a claim with missing or forged documents. However, it does mention that the policy shall be void and all premium paid thereon shall be forfeited to the Company in the event of misrepresentation, misdescription or non-disclosure of any material fact by the policyholder. It also states that the company can reject a claim if they decide to, and will communicate the grounds for rejection in writing.","No, the policy states that pre- and post-hospitalization medical expenses are covered only if a claim for in-patient hospitalization has been accepted and the expenses are related to the same illness or injury. The company is not liable to make any reimbursements of Medical Expenses or pay any other amounts not specified in the Policy.","Not relevant to the context. The provided documents detail claim procedures, timelines for document submission, and specific inclusions/exclusions within the context of a particular insurance policy, but do not contain information about medical procedures not allowed under insurance worldwide.","The policy explicitly states that any fraudulent claim will result in forfeiture of benefits and premium, and any amounts already paid must be repaid. The company may also take legal action against individuals who commit fraud."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 19965.23 ms

This falls under the Right to Equality.","Yes, Article 17 of the Constitution abolishes \"Untouchability\" and forbids its practice in any form.

This is a key provision under the Right against Exploitation, which is part of Part III of the Constitution.","Article 359 suspends the enforcement of rights conferred by Part III during emergencies, except for articles 20 and 21.

It clarifies that this power is not limited by the preceding articles (5 to 10) in Part II, meaning Parliament can create laws that might change or even replace existing articles related to citizenship.
