} | Response: {"answers":["Yes, the grace period for premium payment is 30 days. This allows the policy to be renewed or continued without losing continuity benefits related to waiting periods and pre-existing diseases. However, coverage is not available during the grace period if the premium is not received.","The waiting period for pre-existing diseases (PED) is generally 36 months. However, this exclusion shall not be applicable for claims arising due to an accident. Also, if any specified disease/procedure falls under the waiting period specified for Pre-Existing Diseases, then the longer of the two waiting periods shall apply.","Yes, the policy covers maternity expenses, including childbirth (complicated deliveries and caesarean sections) and lawful medical termination of pregnancy. However, there's a waiting period of 24 months, and the insured person should be between 18 and 45 years of age. The coverage amount is subject to the Table of Benefits, with specific limits for normal and caesarean deliveries.","Yes, there is a waiting period for cataract surgery. According to the document, cataract is listed under the \"Two years waiting period\" section. However, the document also mentions a limit for cataract surgery after continuous coverage, specifying \"Up to 15% of SI or INR 60,000 whichever is lower\".","No, the policy has specific exclusions related to organ transplants. These exclusions include pre- and post-hospitalization expenses of the organ donor, costs associated with acquiring the donor's organ, experimental transplants, complications for the donor, and expenses for organ transportation or preservation. However, medical expenses for the organ donor are covered if the donation confirms to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994, the organ is for an insured person, and the expenses are incurred as an in-patient in a hospital.","Yes, a No Claim Discount (NCD) of 5% is offered on the base premium upon renewal if no claims are reported during the expiring policy term. For policies exceeding one year, the NCD for each claim-free year is aggregated, but the total NCD cannot exceed 5% of the total base premium for the policy term.","Yes, health check-up expenses shall be reimbursed (irrespective of past claims) at the end of a block of two continuous policy years, provided the policy has been continuously renewed with the Company without a break. Expenses payable are subject to the limit stated in the Table of Benefits.","The policy defines a hospital as an establishment registered with local authorities under the Clinical Establishments Act, 2010, or complying with minimum criteria. It also mentions in-patient treatment and pre-hospitalization expenses that the company shall indemnify.","Yes, the company shall indemnify medical expenses incurred for inpatient care treatment under Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy systems of medicines during each Policy Period up to the limit of Sum Insured as specified in the Policy Schedule in any AYUSH Hospital. An AYUSH Hospital is a healthcare facility where medical treatments are carried out by AYUSH Medical Practitioners.","Yes, room charges and intensive care unit charges per day are payable up to the limit as shown in the Table of Benefits for Plan A. However, this limit does not apply if the treatment is undergone for a listed procedure in a Preferred Provider Network (PPN) as a package."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 85545.33 ms

} | Response: {"answers":["The grace period for premium payment is thirty days. This period immediately follows the premium due date, allowing policyholders to renew or continue their policy without losing continuity benefits related to waiting periods and pre-existing disease coverage. However, coverage is not available during the grace period if the premium is not received.","The policy excludes expenses related to the treatment of pre-existing diseases (PED) and their direct complications. The provided context does not specify a waiting period for PED coverage, only that they are initially excluded.","No, this policy does not cover maternity expenses. The provided context states that expenses incurred for maternity or infertility are specifically excluded from domiciliary hospitalization coverage.","Yes, the waiting period for cataract surgery is two years. This is listed under the \"Two years waiting period\" section in the provided document.","Yes, medical expenses incurred for the organ donor as an in-patient in a hospital are covered under this policy. The organ donation must also conform to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994 and its amendments, and the organ must be used for an insured person who has been medically advised to undergo a transplant.","Yes, the policy offers a No Claim Discount (NCD). On renewal of policies with a one-year term, a flat 5% NCD is allowed on the base premium, provided no claims were reported during the expiring policy. For policies exceeding one year, the NCD amount for each claim-free year is aggregated, but the total NCD cannot exceed 5% of the total base premium for the policy term.","Yes, health check-up expenses are reimbursed (irrespective of past claims) at the end of a block of two continuous policy years, provided the policy has been continuously renewed without a break. Expenses payable are subject to the limit stated in the Table of Benefits.","The provided context does not define \"Hospital\". However, it mentions portability norms for insured persons with continuous coverage, which is related to healthcare and potentially hospital stays.","AYUSH Treatment refers to medical and/or hospitalization treatments given in Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy systems.

} | Response: {"answers":["According to Newton, the quantity of motion is the measure of motion arising from the velocity and quantity of matter combined. The provided text defines force as a cause that alters the state of a body, while quantity of motion is a measure of the motion itself, based on velocity and mass. Thus, force is what *causes* changes in motion, while quantity of motion is a *description* of the motion.","The context mentions Newton's Third Law of Motion, stating that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. It also describes the law of gravitation, where bodies attract each other with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, which is used to explain the motions of celestial bodies. The context does not explicitly list all three laws of motion.","The provided context does not explicitly detail Newton's derivation of Kepler's Second Law. However, it mentions the relationship between force, time, and velocity, and refers to areas analogous to equal times and gravitating forces. This hints at the concepts used in the derivation, which involves showing that a central force (like gravity) results in a constant areal velocity, equivalent to Kepler's Second Law.","Yes, Newton demonstrates that the weight of two mutually gravitating spheres is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers, assuming uniform matter distribution around the centers. He also shows that a planet acted upon by an attractive force varying inversely as the square of the distance will describe an elliptical orbit.","Yes, Newton argues for universal gravitation based on observations and experiments showing that bodies near Earth gravitate towards it, the moon gravitates towards Earth, the sea towards the moon, planets mutually attract, and comets gravitate towards the sun. He concludes that all bodies possess a principle of mutual gravitation, proportional to their quantity of matter.","Newton explains that the perturbation of a planet's orbit is due to the excess of greater impulses acting upon some bodies and not acting upon others, changing their situation. The perturbation of Jupiter's orbit is less than Saturn's because the force disturbing Jupiter's motion is proportional to the difference in their masses. The Earth's orbit is also disturbed by the moon.","Yes, Newton used his \"fluxionary calculus\" in Principia, a precursor to modern calculus. However, the algorithm or notation for his fluxionary calculus didn't appear in Principia itself, but was published later in the second volume of Dr. Wallis's works in 1693.","Yes, Newton explains that a centripetal force, later identified as gravity, is necessary to constantly draw a celestial body towards a central point, preventing it from moving in a straight line and causing it to revolve in an orbit. Without this force, like the one retaining the moon in its orbit, the body would not stay in orbit.","Yes, Newton addresses motion in resisting media. He explains that projectiles moving through fluids experience resistance due to the pressure difference between the front and rear, and that the pressure from compression generates motion in the fluid, creating resistance. He also explores how the density and subtilty of the medium affect resistance, particularly at high speeds.","Newton believed in absolute space and time as immutable and independent entities, serving as the true reference frame for all motion. Relative motion, on the other hand, is defined with respect to other bodies and can be affected by forces without altering true motion, whereas absolute motion is a translation from one absolute place to another. This concept of absolute space and time provides a fixed backdrop against which Newton's laws of motion, particularly inertia, can be consistently applied.","Yes, according to the provided text, the grandfather of Sir Isaac Newton was Robert Newton. The text also mentions that the descent of Sir Isaac beyond his grandfather cannot be traced with certainty, but there were two family traditions about their origins.","No, beyond his grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac cannot with certainty be traced. There were two traditions in the family: one, that they were of Scotch extraction; the other, that they came originally from Newton, in Lancashire."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 160494.97 ms

} | Response: {"answers":["According to Newton, the quantity of motion is the measure of motion arising from the velocity and quantity of matter combined. The provided text defines forces as motive, accelerative, and absolute, relating to the endeavor of a body towards a center, the power diffused from the center, and the central force itself, respectively. Thus, quantity of motion is related to the object itself, while force is related to the interaction of objects.","The context mentions Newton's Third Law of Motion, stating that to every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction. It also discusses the law of gravitation, where bodies attract each other with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, which explains the motions of celestial bodies. The context does not explicitly state all three laws of motion.","The provided context does not explicitly detail Newton's derivation of Kepler's Second Law. However, Chunk 890 mentions \"equal times and equal gravitating forces\" being analogous to areas under a hyperbola, which relates to the concept of equal areas in equal times. The document also references Lemma VII and VIII, Book I, which are likely relevant to the derivation but are not included in the context.","Yes, Newton demonstrated that a planet acted upon by an attractive force varying inversely as the squares of the distances will describe an elliptical orbit, in one of whose foci the attractive force resides. He also stated that the weight of either sphere towards the other will be reciprocally as the square of the distance between their centres.","Yes, Newton argues that based on experiments and astronomical observations, bodies gravitate towards the Earth in proportion to their mass, and celestial bodies mutually gravitate towards each other. Therefore, he concludes that all bodies universally possess a principle of mutual gravitation. He also states that the argument for universal gravitation is stronger than that for impenetrability.","Newton explains that the perturbation of a planet's orbit is proportional to the difference in the disturbing force exerted by other planets. For example, the perturbation of Jupiter's orbit is less than Saturn's because the force disturbing Jupiter is smaller. He also notes the Earth's orbit is noticeably disturbed by the moon.","Yes, Newton's Principia presented the fundamental principle of his fluxionary calculus, a precursor to modern calculus, in the second Lemma of the second book. However, the algorithm or notation for his calculus did not appear in Principia; it was published later in the second volume of Dr. Wallis's works in 1693.","Yes, Newton explains that a centripetal force, later identified as gravity, constantly pulls celestial bodies towards a central point, preventing them from moving in a straight line. This force causes them to revolve in orbits, as seen with the moon being held in its orbit around the Earth.","Yes, Newton addresses motion in resisting media by considering the pressure exerted by the fluid on a projectile, which arises from the difference in pressure between the front and rear. He notes that this resistance is related to the motion generated in the fluid and is not significantly diminished by the subtilty of the medium at high speeds. Additionally, he explores the concept of an ethereal medium and investigates whether resistance is solely on the surface of bodies or also within their internal parts.","Newton believed in absolute space and time as immutable and independent entities, serving as the true reference frame for all motion. Relative motion, in contrast, is defined by the movement of objects relative to each other, which Newton considered a practical but not fundamental measure. This concept of absolute space and time provides a fixed backdrop against which his laws of motion could be universally applied.","Yes, according to the text, the grandfather of Sir Isaac Newton was Robert Newton. The text also mentions two traditions about the family's origins: one suggesting Scottish extraction and the other tracing them back to Newton in Lancashire.","No, beyond his grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac cannot with certainty be traced. There are two traditions: one, that they were of Scotch extraction; the other, that they came originally from Newton, in Lancashire."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 39394.99 ms

} | Response: {"answers":["The ideal spark plug gap is 0.8-0.9 mm. This measurement should be checked using a wire-type feeler gauge, and the side electrode should be carefully bent if adjustment is needed.","Yes, this vehicle uses tubeless tires. The rims are designed for tubeless tires, and using tube-type tires could cause rapid deflation during hard acceleration or braking. It is recommended to use the tire size and type specified in the owner's manual and visit an authorized Hero MotoCorp workshop for tire repairs or replacements.","No, it is not compulsory to have a disc brake. The vehicle specifications mention both \"Disc-Drum\" and \"Drum-Drum\" variants, indicating that a drum brake option is available. For the disc variant, it is important to maintain the brake fluid level between the brake pads, caliper, and disc, and to use DoT-4/DoT-3 brake fluid.","No, you cannot use Thums Up instead of engine oil. Engine oil is crucial for engine performance and longevity, and the document specifically recommends against using non-detergent, vegetable, or castor-based racing oils. Using Thums Up, which is a carbonated beverage, would cause serious engine damage.","The context does not contain information about generating Javascript code. Here's the code to generate a random number between 1 and 100: `Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;` This code uses `Math.random()` to generate a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), multiplies it by 100, takes the floor to get an integer between 0 and 99, and then adds 1 to get a number between 1 and 100."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 15973.64 ms

} | Response: {"answers":["Yes, the grace period for premium payment is thirty days. This grace period allows policyholders to renew or continue their policy without losing continuity benefits related to waiting periods and pre-existing diseases. However, coverage is not available during this grace period if the premium is not received.","Coverage for pre-existing diseases (PEDs) begins after a waiting period of 36 months, but only for PEDs declared in the Proposal Form and accepted by the Company. However, this exclusion shall not be applicable for claims arising due to an accident. There are also specific waiting periods for certain lifestyle conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac conditions (90 days) and other specific diseases/procedures (one year).","Yes, the policy covers maternity expenses, including medical treatment expenses traceable to childbirth (including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections) and lawful medical termination of pregnancy. However, there's a waiting period of 24 months, and the insured person should be between 18 and 45 years of age. The coverage also excludes maternity expenses of a surrogate mother unless the claim is admitted under the infertility section.","Yes, there is a waiting period for cataract surgery. According to the provided context, cataract is listed under \"iii. Two years waiting period.\" However, the context also mentions a limit for cataract surgery after continuous coverage, suggesting coverage after 36 months.","The medical expenses for an organ donor are covered under this policy if the organ donation confirms to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994, the organ is used for an insured person who has been medically advised to undergo a transplant, the expenses are incurred as an in-patient in a hospital, and the claim has been admitted under the In-patient Treatment Section. However, the policy excludes pre- and post-hospitalization expenses of the donor, costs associated with organ acquisition, experimental transplants, complications for the donor due to harvesting, and organ transportation or preservation expenses.","Yes, a No Claim Discount (NCD) of 5% is offered on the base premium upon renewal of policies with a one-year term, provided no claims were reported during the expiring policy. For policies exceeding one year, the NCD is aggregated for each claim-free year, but the total NCD cannot exceed 5% of the total base premium for the policy term.","Yes, health check-up expenses are reimbursed at the end of a block of two continuous policy years, irrespective of past claims, provided the policy has been continuously renewed without a break. Expenses payable are subject to the limit stated in the Table of Benefits.","The policy defines a hospital as an entity registered with local authorities under the Clinical Establishments Act, 2010, or equivalent enactments. Alternatively, it can be an entity that complies with all minimum criteria as defined in the policy.","Yes, the company shall indemnify medical expenses incurred for inpatient care under Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy systems of medicines during each policy period up to the limit of the sum insured as specified in the policy schedule in any AYUSH Hospital. An AYUSH Hospital is a healthcare facility where medical treatments are carried out by AYUSH Medical Practitioners.","Yes, for Plan A, room charges and intensive care unit charges per day are payable up to the limit shown in the Table of Benefits. However, this limit does not apply if the treatment is undergone for a listed procedure in a Preferred Provider Network (PPN) as a package."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 35622.74 ms

However, there is a waiting period of 24 months, and the insured person must be between 18 and 45 years of age. The policy may not cover maternity expenses for surrogate mothers unless the claim is admitted under the infertility section.","The waiting period for cataract surgery is two years, as it is listed under the \"Two years waiting period\" section. However, after continuous coverage, there is a limit for cataract surgery of up to 15% of the Sum Insured (SI) or INR 60,000, whichever is lower.","The medical expenses for an organ donor are covered under this policy if the organ donation confirms to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994, the organ is used for an insured person who has been medically advised to undergo a transplant, and the medical expenses are incurred for the organ donor as an in-patient in a hospital. However, the policy excludes pre- and post-hospitalization expenses of the organ donor, costs associated with the acquisition of the donor's organ, experimental transplants, complications for the donor due to harvesting, and organ transportation or preservation expenses.","Yes, a No Claim Discount (NCD) of 5% is allowed on the base premium for policies with a one-year term, provided no claims are reported. For policies exceeding one year, the NCD amount is aggregated for each claim-free year, but the total NCD cannot exceed 5% of the total base premium for the policy term.","I encountered an error while processing your question.

The provided text explicitly warns against installing a tube inside a tubeless tire and emphasizes the use of only tubeless tires due to the rim design, which could cause rapid deflation with tube-type tires during hard acceleration or braking.","The context indicates there are \"Disc-Drum\" and \"Drum-Drum\" variants for the vehicle, suggesting disc brakes are not compulsory. For the disc variant, it is recommended to clean the brake pads, caliper, and disc with a water jet and to use DoT-4/DoT-3 brake fluid. The brake fluid level should also be maintained above the \"MIN\" mark.","No, you cannot use Thums Up instead of engine oil. The context emphasizes the importance of using the recommended grade of engine oil for optimal engine performance and longevity, and cautions against using non-detergent, vegetable, or castor-based racing oils. Using Thums Up would likely cause severe engine damage.","Not relevant to the context.

} | Response: {"answers":["Yes, the grace period for premium payment is 30 days. This allows the policy to be renewed or continued without losing continuity benefits related to waiting periods and pre-existing diseases. Coverage is not available during the grace period if the premium is not received.","Pre-existing diseases (PEDs) are covered after a waiting period of 36 months. However, this applies only to PEDs declared in the proposal form and accepted for coverage by the company. There are also specific waiting periods for certain diseases/procedures, such as 90 days for hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac conditions.","Yes, the policy covers maternity expenses, including medical treatment expenses traceable to childbirth (including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections) and lawful medical termination of pregnancy. However, there are exclusions, such as treatment for covered female insured persons below eighteen (18) years and above forty-five (45) years of age, delivery or termination within a waiting period of twenty-four (24) months, more than one delivery or lawful medical termination of pregnancy during a single Policy Period, Maternity Expenses of Surrogate Mother, and Ectopic pregnancy.","Yes, there is a waiting period for cataract surgery. Based on the provided context, cataract is listed under \"iii. Two years waiting period\". However, the context also mentions a limit for cataract surgery being covered after 36 months and a limit for cataract surgery (for each eye per insured person) up to 15% of SI or INR 60,000 whichever is lower.","The medical expenses for an organ donor are covered under this policy if the organ donation confirms to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994, the organ is used for an insured person who has been medically advised to undergo a transplant, and the medical expenses are incurred for the donor as an in-patient in a hospital. However, the policy excludes pre- and post-hospitalization expenses of the organ donor, costs associated with the acquisition of the donor's organ, experimental transplants, complications for the donor due to harvesting, and expenses related to organ transportation or preservation.","Yes, a No Claim Discount (NCD) of 5% is offered on the base premium upon renewal of policies with a one-year term, provided no claims were reported during the expiring policy. For policies exceeding one year, the NCD is aggregated for each claim-free year, but the total NCD cannot exceed 5% of the total base premium for the policy term.","Yes, health check-up expenses shall be reimbursed (irrespective of past claims) at the end of a block of two continuous policy years, provided the Policy has been continuously renewed with the Company without a break. Expenses payable are subject to the limit stated in the Table of Benefits.","The policy defines a hospital as an entity registered with local authorities under the Clinical Establishments Act, 2010, or equivalent enactments. Alternatively, it can be an entity that complies with minimum criteria, though those criteria are not specified in this context.","Yes, the company shall indemnify medical expenses incurred for inpatient care treatment under Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy systems of medicines during each Policy Period up to the limit of Sum Insured as specified in the Policy Schedule in any AYUSH Hospital. An AYUSH Hospital is a healthcare facility where medical treatments are carried out by AYUSH Medical Practitioners.","Yes, room charges and intensive care unit charges per day are payable up to the limit shown in the Table of Benefits for Plan A only, as per Section 3.1.1.1. However, this limit does not apply if the treatment is undergone for a listed procedure in a Preferred Provider Network (PPN) as a package."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 28227.76 ms

} | Response: {"answers":["According to Newton, the quantity of motion is the measure of motion arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjointly. The provided context does not explicitly detail how \"quantity of motion\" is distinct from \"force,\" but it does define force as that which alters the state of a body, whether it be rest or uniform motion.","The context mentions Newton's Third Law of Motion, stating that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. It also discusses the laws of motion and gravitation being discovered through experimental philosophy and their application to celestial bodies. However, the context does not explicitly list all three laws of motion.","The provided context does not explicitly detail Newton's derivation of Kepler's Second Law. However, Chunk 890 mentions \"areas AB^K, K</rL, LrsM, MsJN, (fee., will be equal, and therefore analogous to the equal times and equal gravitating forces,\" which alludes to the concept of equal areas in equal times, a core component of Kepler's Second Law.","Yes, Newton demonstrates that the weight of two spheres mutually gravitating towards each other is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers, assuming uniform matter distribution. He also shows that a planet acted upon by an attractive force varying inversely as the square of the distance will describe an elliptical orbit.","Newton argues for universal gravitation based on observations and experiments showing that bodies near Earth gravitate towards it proportionally to their mass, the moon gravitates towards Earth, the sea towards the moon, planets mutually attract, and comets attract the sun. He concludes that all bodies possess a principle of mutual gravitation.","Newton explains that the perturbation of a planet's orbit is due to the excess of impulses acting upon some bodies and not others, changing their relative positions. He also notes that the perturbation of Jupiter's orbit is less than Saturn's, and that the Earth's orbit is noticeably disturbed by the moon.","Yes, Newton's *Principia* presented the fundamental principle of his fluxionary calculus in the second Lemma of the second book. However, its algorithm or notation did not appear until published in the second volume of Dr. Wallis's works in 1693, and Newton's notation for calculus was not standard at the time.","Newton explains that a centripetal force, later identified as gravity, is necessary to constantly draw a celestial body towards a central point, preventing it from moving in a straight line and causing it to revolve in an orbit. Without this force, like the one retaining the moon in its orbit, the body would not stay in orbit.","Newton explores the motion of fluids and the resistance encountered by projected bodies. He posits that projectiles moving through fluids generate motion due to pressure differences and that the resistance experienced by bodies in motion can be influenced by a subtle ethereal medium pervading all matter. He also notes that in elastic fluids, resistance is nearly equal for bodies moving at extreme speeds, regardless of the fluid's subtilty.","Newton defines absolute space and time as immutable and independent of any observer, serving as a fixed reference frame for all motion. Relative motion, on the other hand, is defined with respect to other bodies and is subject to change even when true motion remains unaltered. The context supports Newton's laws by establishing a foundation for defining motion and forces in a consistent and universal manner.","Yes, according to the text, the grandfather of Sir Isaac Newton was Robert Newton. The text also mentions two traditions about the family's origins: one suggesting Scottish extraction and the other tracing them back to Newton in Lancashire.","No, beyond Isaac Newton's grandfather, Robert Newton, his descent cannot be traced with certainty. There are two traditions: one suggesting Scottish extraction, and the other indicating origins in Newton, Lancashire, with a period in Westby, Lincolnshire, before settling in Woolsthorpe."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 32086.41 ms
