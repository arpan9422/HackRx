} | Response: {"answers":["Yes, the grace period for premium payment is 30 days. This allows the policy to be renewed or continued without losing continuity benefits related to waiting periods and pre-existing diseases. However, coverage is not available during the grace period if the premium is not received.","The waiting period for pre-existing diseases (PED) is generally 36 months. However, this exclusion shall not be applicable for claims arising due to an accident. Also, if any specified disease/procedure falls under the waiting period specified for Pre-Existing Diseases, then the longer of the two waiting periods shall apply.","Yes, the policy covers maternity expenses, including childbirth (complicated deliveries and caesarean sections) and lawful medical termination of pregnancy. However, there's a waiting period of 24 months, and the insured person should be between 18 and 45 years of age. The coverage amount is subject to the Table of Benefits, with specific limits for normal and caesarean deliveries.","Yes, there is a waiting period for cataract surgery. According to the document, cataract is listed under the \"Two years waiting period\" section. However, the document also mentions a limit for cataract surgery after continuous coverage, specifying \"Up to 15% of SI or INR 60,000 whichever is lower\".","No, the policy has specific exclusions related to organ transplants. These exclusions include pre- and post-hospitalization expenses of the organ donor, costs associated with acquiring the donor's organ, experimental transplants, complications for the donor, and expenses for organ transportation or preservation. However, medical expenses for the organ donor are covered if the donation confirms to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994, the organ is for an insured person, and the expenses are incurred as an in-patient in a hospital.","Yes, a No Claim Discount (NCD) of 5% is offered on the base premium upon renewal if no claims are reported during the expiring policy term. For policies exceeding one year, the NCD for each claim-free year is aggregated, but the total NCD cannot exceed 5% of the total base premium for the policy term.","Yes, health check-up expenses shall be reimbursed (irrespective of past claims) at the end of a block of two continuous policy years, provided the policy has been continuously renewed with the Company without a break. Expenses payable are subject to the limit stated in the Table of Benefits.","The policy defines a hospital as an establishment registered with local authorities under the Clinical Establishments Act, 2010, or complying with minimum criteria. It also mentions in-patient treatment and pre-hospitalization expenses that the company shall indemnify.","Yes, the company shall indemnify medical expenses incurred for inpatient care treatment under Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy systems of medicines during each Policy Period up to the limit of Sum Insured as specified in the Policy Schedule in any AYUSH Hospital. An AYUSH Hospital is a healthcare facility where medical treatments are carried out by AYUSH Medical Practitioners.","Yes, room charges and intensive care unit charges per day are payable up to the limit as shown in the Table of Benefits for Plan A. However, this limit does not apply if the treatment is undergone for a listed procedure in a Preferred Provider Network (PPN) as a package."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 85545.33 ms

} | Response: {"answers":["The grace period for premium payment is thirty days. This period immediately follows the premium due date, allowing policyholders to renew or continue their policy without losing continuity benefits related to waiting periods and pre-existing disease coverage. However, coverage is not available during the grace period if the premium is not received.","The policy excludes expenses related to the treatment of pre-existing diseases (PED) and their direct complications. The provided context does not specify a waiting period for PED coverage, only that they are initially excluded.","No, this policy does not cover maternity expenses. The provided context states that expenses incurred for maternity or infertility are specifically excluded from domiciliary hospitalization coverage.","Yes, the waiting period for cataract surgery is two years. This is listed under the \"Two years waiting period\" section in the provided document.","Yes, medical expenses incurred for the organ donor as an in-patient in a hospital are covered under this policy. The organ donation must also conform to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994 and its amendments, and the organ must be used for an insured person who has been medically advised to undergo a transplant.","Yes, the policy offers a No Claim Discount (NCD). On renewal of policies with a one-year term, a flat 5% NCD is allowed on the base premium, provided no claims were reported during the expiring policy. For policies exceeding one year, the NCD amount for each claim-free year is aggregated, but the total NCD cannot exceed 5% of the total base premium for the policy term.","Yes, health check-up expenses are reimbursed (irrespective of past claims) at the end of a block of two continuous policy years, provided the policy has been continuously renewed without a break. Expenses payable are subject to the limit stated in the Table of Benefits.","The provided context does not define \"Hospital\". However, it mentions portability norms for insured persons with continuous coverage, which is related to healthcare and potentially hospital stays.","AYUSH Treatment refers to medical and/or hospitalization treatments given in Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy systems.

} | Response: {"answers":["According to Newton, the quantity of motion is the measure of motion arising from the velocity and quantity of matter combined. The provided text defines force as a cause that alters the state of a body, while quantity of motion is a measure of the motion itself, based on velocity and mass. Thus, force is what *causes* changes in motion, while quantity of motion is a *description* of the motion.","The context mentions Newton's Third Law of Motion, stating that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. It also describes the law of gravitation, where bodies attract each other with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, which is used to explain the motions of celestial bodies. The context does not explicitly list all three laws of motion.","The provided context does not explicitly detail Newton's derivation of Kepler's Second Law. However, it mentions the relationship between force, time, and velocity, and refers to areas analogous to equal times and gravitating forces. This hints at the concepts used in the derivation, which involves showing that a central force (like gravity) results in a constant areal velocity, equivalent to Kepler's Second Law.","Yes, Newton demonstrates that the weight of two mutually gravitating spheres is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers, assuming uniform matter distribution around the centers. He also shows that a planet acted upon by an attractive force varying inversely as the square of the distance will describe an elliptical orbit.","Yes, Newton argues for universal gravitation based on observations and experiments showing that bodies near Earth gravitate towards it, the moon gravitates towards Earth, the sea towards the moon, planets mutually attract, and comets gravitate towards the sun. He concludes that all bodies possess a principle of mutual gravitation, proportional to their quantity of matter.","Newton explains that the perturbation of a planet's orbit is due to the excess of greater impulses acting upon some bodies and not acting upon others, changing their situation. The perturbation of Jupiter's orbit is less than Saturn's because the force disturbing Jupiter's motion is proportional to the difference in their masses. The Earth's orbit is also disturbed by the moon.","Yes, Newton used his \"fluxionary calculus\" in Principia, a precursor to modern calculus. However, the algorithm or notation for his fluxionary calculus didn't appear in Principia itself, but was published later in the second volume of Dr. Wallis's works in 1693.","Yes, Newton explains that a centripetal force, later identified as gravity, is necessary to constantly draw a celestial body towards a central point, preventing it from moving in a straight line and causing it to revolve in an orbit. Without this force, like the one retaining the moon in its orbit, the body would not stay in orbit.","Yes, Newton addresses motion in resisting media. He explains that projectiles moving through fluids experience resistance due to the pressure difference between the front and rear, and that the pressure from compression generates motion in the fluid, creating resistance. He also explores how the density and subtilty of the medium affect resistance, particularly at high speeds.","Newton believed in absolute space and time as immutable and independent entities, serving as the true reference frame for all motion. Relative motion, on the other hand, is defined with respect to other bodies and can be affected by forces without altering true motion, whereas absolute motion is a translation from one absolute place to another. This concept of absolute space and time provides a fixed backdrop against which Newton's laws of motion, particularly inertia, can be consistently applied.","Yes, according to the provided text, the grandfather of Sir Isaac Newton was Robert Newton. The text also mentions that the descent of Sir Isaac beyond his grandfather cannot be traced with certainty, but there were two family traditions about their origins.","No, beyond his grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac cannot with certainty be traced. There were two traditions in the family: one, that they were of Scotch extraction; the other, that they came originally from Newton, in Lancashire."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 160494.97 ms

} | Response: {"answers":["According to Newton, the quantity of motion is the measure of motion arising from the velocity and quantity of matter combined. The provided text defines forces as motive, accelerative, and absolute, relating to the endeavor of a body towards a center, the power diffused from the center, and the central force itself, respectively. Thus, quantity of motion is related to the object itself, while force is related to the interaction of objects.","The context mentions Newton's Third Law of Motion, stating that to every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction. It also discusses the law of gravitation, where bodies attract each other with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, which explains the motions of celestial bodies. The context does not explicitly state all three laws of motion.","The provided context does not explicitly detail Newton's derivation of Kepler's Second Law. However, Chunk 890 mentions \"equal times and equal gravitating forces\" being analogous to areas under a hyperbola, which relates to the concept of equal areas in equal times. The document also references Lemma VII and VIII, Book I, which are likely relevant to the derivation but are not included in the context.","Yes, Newton demonstrated that a planet acted upon by an attractive force varying inversely as the squares of the distances will describe an elliptical orbit, in one of whose foci the attractive force resides. He also stated that the weight of either sphere towards the other will be reciprocally as the square of the distance between their centres.","Yes, Newton argues that based on experiments and astronomical observations, bodies gravitate towards the Earth in proportion to their mass, and celestial bodies mutually gravitate towards each other. Therefore, he concludes that all bodies universally possess a principle of mutual gravitation. He also states that the argument for universal gravitation is stronger than that for impenetrability.","Newton explains that the perturbation of a planet's orbit is proportional to the difference in the disturbing force exerted by other planets. For example, the perturbation of Jupiter's orbit is less than Saturn's because the force disturbing Jupiter is smaller. He also notes the Earth's orbit is noticeably disturbed by the moon.","Yes, Newton's Principia presented the fundamental principle of his fluxionary calculus, a precursor to modern calculus, in the second Lemma of the second book. However, the algorithm or notation for his calculus did not appear in Principia; it was published later in the second volume of Dr. Wallis's works in 1693.","Yes, Newton explains that a centripetal force, later identified as gravity, constantly pulls celestial bodies towards a central point, preventing them from moving in a straight line. This force causes them to revolve in orbits, as seen with the moon being held in its orbit around the Earth.","Yes, Newton addresses motion in resisting media by considering the pressure exerted by the fluid on a projectile, which arises from the difference in pressure between the front and rear. He notes that this resistance is related to the motion generated in the fluid and is not significantly diminished by the subtilty of the medium at high speeds. Additionally, he explores the concept of an ethereal medium and investigates whether resistance is solely on the surface of bodies or also within their internal parts.","Newton believed in absolute space and time as immutable and independent entities, serving as the true reference frame for all motion. Relative motion, in contrast, is defined by the movement of objects relative to each other, which Newton considered a practical but not fundamental measure. This concept of absolute space and time provides a fixed backdrop against which his laws of motion could be universally applied.","Yes, according to the text, the grandfather of Sir Isaac Newton was Robert Newton. The text also mentions two traditions about the family's origins: one suggesting Scottish extraction and the other tracing them back to Newton in Lancashire.","No, beyond his grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac cannot with certainty be traced. There are two traditions: one, that they were of Scotch extraction; the other, that they came originally from Newton, in Lancashire."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 39394.99 ms

} | Response: {"answers":["The ideal spark plug gap is 0.8-0.9 mm. This measurement should be checked using a wire-type feeler gauge, and the side electrode should be carefully bent if adjustment is needed.","Yes, this vehicle uses tubeless tires. The rims are designed for tubeless tires, and using tube-type tires could cause rapid deflation during hard acceleration or braking. It is recommended to use the tire size and type specified in the owner's manual and visit an authorized Hero MotoCorp workshop for tire repairs or replacements.","No, it is not compulsory to have a disc brake. The vehicle specifications mention both \"Disc-Drum\" and \"Drum-Drum\" variants, indicating that a drum brake option is available. For the disc variant, it is important to maintain the brake fluid level between the brake pads, caliper, and disc, and to use DoT-4/DoT-3 brake fluid.","No, you cannot use Thums Up instead of engine oil. Engine oil is crucial for engine performance and longevity, and the document specifically recommends against using non-detergent, vegetable, or castor-based racing oils. Using Thums Up, which is a carbonated beverage, would cause serious engine damage.","The context does not contain information about generating Javascript code. Here's the code to generate a random number between 1 and 100: `Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;` This code uses `Math.random()` to generate a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), multiplies it by 100, takes the floor to get an integer between 0 and 99, and then adds 1 to get a number between 1 and 100."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 15973.64 ms

} | Response: {"answers":["Yes, the grace period for premium payment is thirty days. This grace period allows policyholders to renew or continue their policy without losing continuity benefits related to waiting periods and pre-existing diseases. However, coverage is not available during this grace period if the premium is not received.","Coverage for pre-existing diseases (PEDs) begins after a waiting period of 36 months, but only for PEDs declared in the Proposal Form and accepted by the Company. However, this exclusion shall not be applicable for claims arising due to an accident. There are also specific waiting periods for certain lifestyle conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac conditions (90 days) and other specific diseases/procedures (one year).","Yes, the policy covers maternity expenses, including medical treatment expenses traceable to childbirth (including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections) and lawful medical termination of pregnancy. However, there's a waiting period of 24 months, and the insured person should be between 18 and 45 years of age. The coverage also excludes maternity expenses of a surrogate mother unless the claim is admitted under the infertility section.","Yes, there is a waiting period for cataract surgery. According to the provided context, cataract is listed under \"iii. Two years waiting period.\" However, the context also mentions a limit for cataract surgery after continuous coverage, suggesting coverage after 36 months.","The medical expenses for an organ donor are covered under this policy if the organ donation confirms to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994, the organ is used for an insured person who has been medically advised to undergo a transplant, the expenses are incurred as an in-patient in a hospital, and the claim has been admitted under the In-patient Treatment Section. However, the policy excludes pre- and post-hospitalization expenses of the donor, costs associated with organ acquisition, experimental transplants, complications for the donor due to harvesting, and organ transportation or preservation expenses.","Yes, a No Claim Discount (NCD) of 5% is offered on the base premium upon renewal of policies with a one-year term, provided no claims were reported during the expiring policy. For policies exceeding one year, the NCD is aggregated for each claim-free year, but the total NCD cannot exceed 5% of the total base premium for the policy term.","Yes, health check-up expenses are reimbursed at the end of a block of two continuous policy years, irrespective of past claims, provided the policy has been continuously renewed without a break. Expenses payable are subject to the limit stated in the Table of Benefits.","The policy defines a hospital as an entity registered with local authorities under the Clinical Establishments Act, 2010, or equivalent enactments. Alternatively, it can be an entity that complies with all minimum criteria as defined in the policy.","Yes, the company shall indemnify medical expenses incurred for inpatient care under Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy systems of medicines during each policy period up to the limit of the sum insured as specified in the policy schedule in any AYUSH Hospital. An AYUSH Hospital is a healthcare facility where medical treatments are carried out by AYUSH Medical Practitioners.","Yes, for Plan A, room charges and intensive care unit charges per day are payable up to the limit shown in the Table of Benefits. However, this limit does not apply if the treatment is undergone for a listed procedure in a Preferred Provider Network (PPN) as a package."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 35622.74 ms

However, there is a waiting period of 24 months, and the insured person must be between 18 and 45 years of age. The policy may not cover maternity expenses for surrogate mothers unless the claim is admitted under the infertility section.","The waiting period for cataract surgery is two years, as it is listed under the \"Two years waiting period\" section. However, after continuous coverage, there is a limit for cataract surgery of up to 15% of the Sum Insured (SI) or INR 60,000, whichever is lower.","The medical expenses for an organ donor are covered under this policy if the organ donation confirms to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994, the organ is used for an insured person who has been medically advised to undergo a transplant, and the medical expenses are incurred for the organ donor as an in-patient in a hospital. However, the policy excludes pre- and post-hospitalization expenses of the organ donor, costs associated with the acquisition of the donor's organ, experimental transplants, complications for the donor due to harvesting, and organ transportation or preservation expenses.","Yes, a No Claim Discount (NCD) of 5% is allowed on the base premium for policies with a one-year term, provided no claims are reported. For policies exceeding one year, the NCD amount is aggregated for each claim-free year, but the total NCD cannot exceed 5% of the total base premium for the policy term.","I encountered an error while processing your question.

The provided text explicitly warns against installing a tube inside a tubeless tire and emphasizes the use of only tubeless tires due to the rim design, which could cause rapid deflation with tube-type tires during hard acceleration or braking.","The context indicates there are \"Disc-Drum\" and \"Drum-Drum\" variants for the vehicle, suggesting disc brakes are not compulsory. For the disc variant, it is recommended to clean the brake pads, caliper, and disc with a water jet and to use DoT-4/DoT-3 brake fluid. The brake fluid level should also be maintained above the \"MIN\" mark.","No, you cannot use Thums Up instead of engine oil. The context emphasizes the importance of using the recommended grade of engine oil for optimal engine performance and longevity, and cautions against using non-detergent, vegetable, or castor-based racing oils. Using Thums Up would likely cause severe engine damage.","Not relevant to the context.

} | Response: {"answers":["Yes, the grace period for premium payment is 30 days. This allows the policy to be renewed or continued without losing continuity benefits related to waiting periods and pre-existing diseases. Coverage is not available during the grace period if the premium is not received.","Pre-existing diseases (PEDs) are covered after a waiting period of 36 months. However, this applies only to PEDs declared in the proposal form and accepted for coverage by the company. There are also specific waiting periods for certain diseases/procedures, such as 90 days for hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac conditions.","Yes, the policy covers maternity expenses, including medical treatment expenses traceable to childbirth (including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections) and lawful medical termination of pregnancy. However, there are exclusions, such as treatment for covered female insured persons below eighteen (18) years and above forty-five (45) years of age, delivery or termination within a waiting period of twenty-four (24) months, more than one delivery or lawful medical termination of pregnancy during a single Policy Period, Maternity Expenses of Surrogate Mother, and Ectopic pregnancy.","Yes, there is a waiting period for cataract surgery. Based on the provided context, cataract is listed under \"iii. Two years waiting period\". However, the context also mentions a limit for cataract surgery being covered after 36 months and a limit for cataract surgery (for each eye per insured person) up to 15% of SI or INR 60,000 whichever is lower.","The medical expenses for an organ donor are covered under this policy if the organ donation confirms to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994, the organ is used for an insured person who has been medically advised to undergo a transplant, and the medical expenses are incurred for the donor as an in-patient in a hospital. However, the policy excludes pre- and post-hospitalization expenses of the organ donor, costs associated with the acquisition of the donor's organ, experimental transplants, complications for the donor due to harvesting, and expenses related to organ transportation or preservation.","Yes, a No Claim Discount (NCD) of 5% is offered on the base premium upon renewal of policies with a one-year term, provided no claims were reported during the expiring policy. For policies exceeding one year, the NCD is aggregated for each claim-free year, but the total NCD cannot exceed 5% of the total base premium for the policy term.","Yes, health check-up expenses shall be reimbursed (irrespective of past claims) at the end of a block of two continuous policy years, provided the Policy has been continuously renewed with the Company without a break. Expenses payable are subject to the limit stated in the Table of Benefits.","The policy defines a hospital as an entity registered with local authorities under the Clinical Establishments Act, 2010, or equivalent enactments. Alternatively, it can be an entity that complies with minimum criteria, though those criteria are not specified in this context.","Yes, the company shall indemnify medical expenses incurred for inpatient care treatment under Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy systems of medicines during each Policy Period up to the limit of Sum Insured as specified in the Policy Schedule in any AYUSH Hospital. An AYUSH Hospital is a healthcare facility where medical treatments are carried out by AYUSH Medical Practitioners.","Yes, room charges and intensive care unit charges per day are payable up to the limit shown in the Table of Benefits for Plan A only, as per Section 3.1.1.1. However, this limit does not apply if the treatment is undergone for a listed procedure in a Preferred Provider Network (PPN) as a package."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 28227.76 ms

} | Response: {"answers":["According to Newton, the quantity of motion is the measure of motion arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjointly. The provided context does not explicitly detail how \"quantity of motion\" is distinct from \"force,\" but it does define force as that which alters the state of a body, whether it be rest or uniform motion.","The context mentions Newton's Third Law of Motion, stating that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. It also discusses the laws of motion and gravitation being discovered through experimental philosophy and their application to celestial bodies. However, the context does not explicitly list all three laws of motion.","The provided context does not explicitly detail Newton's derivation of Kepler's Second Law. However, Chunk 890 mentions \"areas AB^K, K</rL, LrsM, MsJN, (fee., will be equal, and therefore analogous to the equal times and equal gravitating forces,\" which alludes to the concept of equal areas in equal times, a core component of Kepler's Second Law.","Yes, Newton demonstrates that the weight of two spheres mutually gravitating towards each other is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers, assuming uniform matter distribution. He also shows that a planet acted upon by an attractive force varying inversely as the square of the distance will describe an elliptical orbit.","Newton argues for universal gravitation based on observations and experiments showing that bodies near Earth gravitate towards it proportionally to their mass, the moon gravitates towards Earth, the sea towards the moon, planets mutually attract, and comets attract the sun. He concludes that all bodies possess a principle of mutual gravitation.","Newton explains that the perturbation of a planet's orbit is due to the excess of impulses acting upon some bodies and not others, changing their relative positions. He also notes that the perturbation of Jupiter's orbit is less than Saturn's, and that the Earth's orbit is noticeably disturbed by the moon.","Yes, Newton's *Principia* presented the fundamental principle of his fluxionary calculus in the second Lemma of the second book. However, its algorithm or notation did not appear until published in the second volume of Dr. Wallis's works in 1693, and Newton's notation for calculus was not standard at the time.","Newton explains that a centripetal force, later identified as gravity, is necessary to constantly draw a celestial body towards a central point, preventing it from moving in a straight line and causing it to revolve in an orbit. Without this force, like the one retaining the moon in its orbit, the body would not stay in orbit.","Newton explores the motion of fluids and the resistance encountered by projected bodies. He posits that projectiles moving through fluids generate motion due to pressure differences and that the resistance experienced by bodies in motion can be influenced by a subtle ethereal medium pervading all matter. He also notes that in elastic fluids, resistance is nearly equal for bodies moving at extreme speeds, regardless of the fluid's subtilty.","Newton defines absolute space and time as immutable and independent of any observer, serving as a fixed reference frame for all motion. Relative motion, on the other hand, is defined with respect to other bodies and is subject to change even when true motion remains unaltered. The context supports Newton's laws by establishing a foundation for defining motion and forces in a consistent and universal manner.","Yes, according to the text, the grandfather of Sir Isaac Newton was Robert Newton. The text also mentions two traditions about the family's origins: one suggesting Scottish extraction and the other tracing them back to Newton in Lancashire.","No, beyond Isaac Newton's grandfather, Robert Newton, his descent cannot be traced with certainty. There are two traditions: one suggesting Scottish extraction, and the other indicating origins in Newton, Lancashire, with a period in Westby, Lincolnshire, before settling in Woolsthorpe."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 32086.41 ms

Additionally, the expenses would not be covered if they are not considered a reasonable charge or a Medically Necessary Treatment, or if the drugs or treatments are not supported by a prescription.","Yes, the prosthetic device is payable as it is required in connection with the surgery. The walker and lumbar belt are generally not payable unless the lumbar belt was for a surgery of the lumbar spine.","No, the context focuses on orthodontic treatment for dependent children *below* 18, requiring pre-authorization with specific documentation. It does not address dental surgery eligibility or the process for dependents above 18 but under 26.","The cost of Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) is covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. ICU charges include expenses for the ICU bed, general medical support services, monitoring devices, critical care nursing, and intensivist charges. The context does not specify any limitations based on city population size.","Yes, a newly adopted child can be added as an insured person during the policy period if the application is accepted, the pro-rata premium is received, and an endorsement confirming the addition is issued. The provided context does not specify circumstances under which the insurer may refuse cover for the child, but general insurance principles allow refusal based on factors like fraud, misrepresentation, or policy terms.","The initial daycare cataract claim should be filed immediately after discharge for cashless, or within 15 days for reimbursement with required documents. The subsequent inpatient claim for complications, being for the same illness, follows the same process; payment is upfront in a non-network hospital, with reimbursement claim submission within 15 days of discharge, including claim form and relevant documents.","Yes, the newborn's treatment expenses are likely eligible for a claim, provided the mother is covered, maternity cover was opted for, and written notification was given within the specified timeframe. The policy covers medical treatment expenses traceable to childbirth, including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections, and newborn babies are accepted for cover from birth subject to the limitations of the New Born Baby Benefit Cover.","No, it is likely insufficient. While a discharge summary from a Clinical Psychologist is relevant, the context requires a prescription from an \"attending medical practitioner/surgeon\" for claim reimbursement, and for mental health treatment, the context specifies coverage for treatment by professionals with post-graduate degrees in specific fields like Ayurveda, Homoeopathy, Unani, or Siddha, in addition to Clinical Psychologists. A general practitioner's prescription alone may not meet these requirements.","ECG electrodes are payable up to 5 electrodes for each OT or ICU visit, with one set payable every second day for longer ICU stays. Sterilized gloves are payable, while unsterilized gloves are not.","Yes, both pre- and post-hospitalization expenses can be claimed. The policy covers pre-hospitalization medical expenses incurred 30 days before hospitalization and post-hospitalization medical expenses incurred for 60 days after discharge, provided they relate to the same illness for which inpatient hospitalization was claimed and accepted.","The context doesn't directly address what happens when a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period. However, it states that children above 18 are covered up to 26 if unmarried/unemployed and dependent. It also mentions that a dependent's coverage ends when they cease to be a dependent, unless otherwise agreed for continuation until the end of the policy period.","Reimbursement for medical expenses is proportionate to the ratio of the admissible room rate to the actual room rate. This applies when the room rate exceeds policy limits, but proportionate deductions are waived if the hospital doesn't follow differential billing based on room category. The relevant clause is the Proportionate Clause (Chunk 123).","Yes, the company must communicate the grounds for rejection within 15 days of receiving the final documents. If the claim remains rejected and is not subject to a pending suit within twelve months from the date of rejection, the claim is deemed abandoned. The insured can represent to the company for reconsideration within 15 days of receiving the claims decision.","Yes, the claim is likely eligible. The context defines \"Day Care Treatment\" as medical treatment or surgical procedures undertaken under anesthesia in a hospital/day care center in less than 24 hours due to technological advancement, which would have otherwise required hospitalization of more than 24 hours.","For towns with a population less than 10,00,000, the hospital must have at least 10 in-patient beds, qualified nursing staff round the clock, qualified medical practitioners in charge round the clock, a fully equipped operation theatre, and maintain daily patient records accessible to the insurance company. In all other places (metropolitan areas), the hospital must have at least 15 in-patient beds, while the other requirements remain the same.","Yes, a new employee and their spouse can be added mid-policy if the application is accepted, the pro-rata premium is paid, and an endorsement is issued. Siblings can be covered up to the age of 26 if they are unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. The context does not specify the required documentation.","The provided context discusses coverage for robotic surgeries for other diseases, not specifically cancer. Coverage for robotic surgeries, stereotactic radio surgeries, bronchial thermoplasty and vaporization of the prostate are up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. The context does not differentiate coverage or sub-limits based on whether the procedure is done as a day care procedure versus inpatient hospitalization.","The insured person must immediately notify the insurer for emergency evacuation, which requires pre-authorization. For air ambulance cover, an air ambulance ticket from a registered service provider is needed, and claims for pre and post-hospitalization are settled on a reimbursement basis with cash receipts and supporting documents.","Yes, if the insured person is continuously covered without any break as defined under the applicable norms on portability, then the waiting period for the specific illness would be reduced to the extent of prior coverage. However, waiting periods for listed conditions still apply even if contracted after the policy starts or were declared and accepted without a specific exclusion.","The provided context does not explicitly address coverage for imported medications not normally used in India. However, it mentions that expenses must be no more than what other hospitals or doctors in the same locality would charge for the same treatment. The policy also excludes treatments received in nature cure clinics, spas or similar establishments.","Yes, in the event of the death of a member, their dependents may continue to be covered until the expiry of the policy period at the option of the insured. The policy will end for a member if they die.","Original invoices with payment receipts and implant stickers are required for all implants used during surgeries. If only a generic invoice without the implant sticker is provided, the claim may be subject to further investigation, require additional documentation, or potentially be denied due to lack of supporting evidence.","Yes, home nursing charges may qualify for reimbursement if the medical expenses are for the same condition as the hospitalization, the inpatient hospitalization claim is admissible, and domiciliary hospitalization was medically required because the insured person could not be transferred to a hospital or a hospital bed was unavailable. The treating medical practitioner must confirm in writing the necessity of domiciliary hospitalization.","No, the primary insurer seeks details of other available policies and coordinates with other insurers to settle the balance amount as per policy conditions, provided the insured person submits a written request. If original documents were submitted to another insurer, certified copies and the claim settlement advice from that insurer may be accepted, subject to company satisfaction.","No, expenses related to admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded. Also, any diagnostic expenses which are not related or not incidental to the current diagnosis and treatment are excluded.","The context specifies that any change of nomination must be communicated to the Company in writing and is only effective when an endorsement on the policy is made. In the event of the policyholder's death, the company will pay the nominee named in the policy schedule/certificate/endorsement. If there is no subsisting nominee, payment is made to the legal heirs or representatives. Therefore, without a prior endorsement, a request to update the nominee after the demise of the previous nominee would not be valid.","Based on the provided context, prostheses or medical appliances are generally covered if required for surgery, immediately following surgery for medical necessity, or as part of short-term recuperation. However, the context does not explicitly list scenarios where they are NOT covered, so I cannot provide a definitive list of exclusions.","No, expenses will likely not be reimbursed. The context specifies that treatments received in establishments not registered with local authorities are typically excluded, and while AYUSH treatment is defined, the hospital must meet specific criteria, including registration, to be considered for coverage. Additionally, mental illness coverage may have specific limits as outlined in the policy schedule.","Yes, the network provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer or TPA if there is any change in the diagnosis, treatment plan, or cost of treatment during hospitalization. This process should follow the guidelines outlined in clause V.4.","No, the Pre-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim and Post- Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim shall be processed only after the decision of the main Hospitalisation claim. This means the main hospitalization claim must be assessed and approved before any pre- or post-hospitalization claims are considered.","The context does not directly provide the policyholder's contact details. However, in case of any grievance, the insured person may contact the company through Website: www.uiic.co.in, Toll free: 1800 425 333 33, E-mail: customercare@uiic.co.in, or Courier: Customer Care Department, Head Office, United India Insurance Co. Ltd., 24, Whites Road, Chennai, Tamil Nadu- 600014. The insured person may also approach the grievance cell at any of the Company's branches with the details of grievance.","No, automatically approving all claims is not possible. Claim settlement and rejection cannot be handled by a Third Party Administrator (TPA), and the company may request additional information for claim investigation. All claims are payable in Indian currency only.","Yes, if any claim is fraudulent, involves false statements or declarations, or uses fraudulent means, all benefits under the policy and the premium paid shall be forfeited. Additionally, any amounts already paid against fraudulent claims must be repaid to the insurer by the responsible parties. The insurer may also request additional documents for claim investigation.","Based on the provided context, it's unclear if you can receive reimbursement for expenses not related to hospitalization. The context mentions reimbursement for pre-hospitalization, hospitalization, and post-hospitalization expenses, but it also states that the company is not liable to reimburse medical expenses not specified in the policy. Please refer to your specific policy documents for details on covered expenses.","The insurance policy excludes several medical procedures, including treatments to change body characteristics to the opposite sex, cosmetic or plastic surgery (unless for reconstruction after an accident, burn, cancer, or medically necessary), treatments for external congenital anomalies, and circumcision unless medically necessary. It also excludes treatments that could be done on an outpatient basis, treatments not medically necessary, alternative treatments, and costs related to non-human organ transplants.","No, you cannot submit fraudulent claims successfully.

The context does not specify circumstances under which these expenses would *not* be covered if medically required.","Yes, the prosthetic device required for the hip replacement surgery is payable. The walker and lumbar belt used post-discharge are generally not payable unless the lumbar belt was for a lumbar spine surgery.","No, the context does not specify claim admissibility for dependent children above 18 but under 26. However, for dependent children below 18 requiring orthodontic treatment, pre-authorization is mandatory, and the process involves submitting a detailed treatment plan, X-rays, study models, and cost estimates from the dentist before treatment begins.","The cost of Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) is covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. ICU charges include expenses for the ICU bed, general medical support services, monitoring devices, critical care nursing, and intensivist charges. The context does not specify any additional limitations based on modern treatments or city population size.","Yes, a newly adopted child can be added as a dependent during the policy period if the application is accepted, the pro-rata premium is received, and an endorsement confirming the addition is issued. The provided context does not specify circumstances under which the insurer may refuse cover for the child, but generally, refusal could be based on factors like pre-existing conditions or policy limitations not detailed here.","The initial daycare cataract claim should be filed immediately after discharge for cashless, or within 15 days for reimbursement with required documents. If complications arise requiring inpatient care, a separate claim must be submitted for the second hospitalization, following the same timelines, and including all relevant documents for the new claim.","Yes, the newborn's treatment expenses are likely eligible for a claim, subject to the limitations of the New Born Baby Benefit Cover, provided the mother is covered and maternity cover was opted for. The policy accepts newborns for cover from birth if the mother is covered, with written notification required within a month of the birth, although the context does not specify whether the death of the newborn affects this eligibility.","No, it is likely insufficient. While a discharge summary from a Clinical Psychologist is relevant, the context suggests that claims may require certification from specific mental health professionals with post-graduate degrees in relevant fields like Ayurveda, Homoeopathy, Unani, or Siddha, in addition to Clinical Psychologists. The provided documentation also mentions the need for an attending medical practitioner's certificate regarding diagnosis supported by their prescription.","Yes, ECG electrodes are payable up to 5 electrodes for each OT or ICU visit, with one set payable every second day for longer ICU stays. Sterilized gloves are payable, while unsterilized gloves are not.","Yes, both pre- and post-hospitalization expenses can be claimed. The policy covers pre-hospitalization medical expenses incurred 30 days before hospitalization and post-hospitalization medical expenses incurred 60 days after discharge, provided they relate to the same illness for which inpatient hospitalization was claimed and approved.","The context doesn't explicitly state what happens when a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period. However, it does state that children above 18 are covered up to 26 years old if unmarried/unemployed and dependent. Therefore, coverage would likely terminate when the child turns 26, unless otherwise specified in the policy schedule.","Reimbursement for associated medical expenses is proportionate to how the admissible room rate relates to the actual room rate. This proportionate deduction does not apply if the hospital does not follow differential billing or if expenses are not differentially billed based on room category. The relevant clause is the Proportionate Clause (Chunk 123).","The company must communicate the grounds for rejection within 15 days of receiving the final documents. If the claim remains rejected and is not subject to a pending suit within twelve months from the date of rejection, it is deemed abandoned. The insured can represent to the company for reconsideration within 15 days of receiving the claim decision.","Yes, the claim is likely eligible. The context defines \"Day Care Treatment\" as medical treatment or surgical procedures undertaken under anesthesia in a hospital/day care center in less than 24 hours due to technological advancement, which would have otherwise required hospitalization of more than 24 hours.","For towns with a population less than 10,00,000, the hospital must have at least 10 in-patient beds, qualified nursing staff round the clock, qualified medical practitioners in charge, a fully equipped operation theatre, and maintain daily patient records accessible to the insurance company. In all other places (presumably metropolitan areas), the hospital must have at least 15 in-patient beds, with the other requirements remaining the same.","Yes, a new employee and their spouse can be added mid-policy if the application is accepted, the pro-rata premium is paid, and an endorsement is issued. Siblings can be covered up to the age of 26 if they are unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. The context does not specify the required documentation, but typically includes employee enrollment forms and proof of relationship for dependents.","The context mentions insurance coverage for Robotic Surgeries for other diseases, up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. However, it does not specify coverage details or sub-limits for robotic surgery specifically for cancer, nor does it differentiate between day care procedures and inpatient hospitalization. Therefore, the context does not provide enough information to answer the question.","Yes, the insured person must notify the insurer immediately either at their call center or in writing for emergency evacuation and repatriation, which shall be pre-authorized. For air ambulance cover, an air ambulance ticket for a registered service provider is required, and the claim will be processed as per the reimbursement process after the decision of the main hospitalization claim.","Yes, if the insured person has continuous coverage without any break, as defined under the portability norms, then the waiting period for a specific illness would be reduced to the extent of prior coverage. However, waiting periods for listed conditions still apply even if contracted after the policy starts or were declared and accepted without a specific exclusion.","The provided context does not explicitly address coverage for imported medications not normally used in India. However, it mentions that expenses must be no more than what other hospitals or doctors in the same locality would charge for the same treatment. The context also excludes treatments received in health hydros, nature cure clinics, spas or similar establishments or private beds registered as a nursing home.","Yes, in the event of death of an employee, their dependents may continue to be covered until the expiry of the policy period at the option of the insured. The policy will end for a member if they die.","Original invoices with payment receipts and implant stickers are required for all implants used during surgeries. If only a generic invoice without an implant sticker is provided, the claim may be subject to further investigation, require additional documentation, or potentially be denied due to lack of supporting evidence.","Yes, home nursing charges may qualify for reimbursement if the medical expenses are for the same condition as the hospitalization, the inpatient hospitalization claim is admissible, and domiciliary hospitalization was medically required because the insured person could not be transferred to a hospital or a hospital bed was unavailable. The treating medical practitioner must confirm in writing the need for domiciliary hospitalization.","No, the primary insurer seeks details of other available policies and coordinates with other insurers to settle the balance amount as per policy conditions, provided the insured person submits a written request. In the event of a claim lodged as per Settlement under multiple policies clause and the original documents having been submitted to the other insurer, the company may accept the duly certified documents and claim settlement advice duly certified by the other insurer subject to satisfaction of the company.","No, these expenses are likely not claimable. The policy excludes expenses related to admissions primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only, as well as diagnostic expenses not related or incidental to current diagnosis and treatment (Excl04). Since the evaluation led to no treatment, the expenses fall under this exclusion.","The context specifies that any change of nomination must be communicated to the Company in writing and is only effective when an endorsement on the policy is made. In the event of the policyholder's death, the company will pay the nominee named in the Policy Schedule/Policy Certificate/Endorsement. If there is no subsisting nominee, payment will be made to the legal heirs or legal representatives of the policyholder. The context does not address the specific scenario of updating the nominee after the previous nominee's demise.","Yes, prostheses or medical appliances are not covered if they are for long-term recuperation, not immediately following surgery, or not medically necessary. The policy also excludes external congenital anomaly or defects, and services not considered a Medically Necessary Treatment.","No, expenses may not be reimbursed. Treatment in hospitals not registered with local authorities may not be covered, and the context specifies limits on mental illness coverage. Additionally, treatment in nature cure clinics or similar establishments is excluded.","Yes, the network provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer or TPA if there is any change in the diagnosis, treatment plan, or cost of treatment during hospitalization. This process should follow the guidelines outlined in the policy.","No, the Pre-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim and Post- Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim shall be processed only after decision of the main Hospitalisation claim.","The provided context does not contain the policyholder's contact details. However, it does provide contact information for United India Insurance Co. Ltd. for grievance redressal, including their website (www.uiic.co.in), toll-free number (1800 425 333 33), email (customercare@uiic.co.in), and mailing address.","No, automatically approving all claims is not possible. Claim settlement and rejection cannot be done by a TPA and the company may ask for additional documents for claim investigation. All claims under the policy are payable in Indian currency only.","Yes, if any claim is fraudulent, involves false statements or declarations, or uses fraudulent means, all benefits under the policy and the premium paid shall be forfeited. Additionally, any amounts already paid against fraudulent claims must be repaid to the insurer by the responsible parties. The insurer may also request additional documents for claim investigation.","No, the context specifies reimbursement timelines for hospitalization, daycare, pre-hospitalization, and post-hospitalization expenses. It also mentions that the company is not liable to make reimbursements for medical expenses not specified in the policy.","The insurance policy generally excludes expenses related to cosmetic or plastic surgery (unless for reconstruction following an accident, burn, or cancer), treatment to change the body to the opposite sex, external congenital anomalies, circumcision (unless medically necessary), treatments that could be done on an outpatient basis, treatments not medically necessary, alternative treatments, and charges related to hospital stays not expressly covered. It also excludes treatments specifically excluded in the Policy Schedule/ Certificate of Insurance.","No, you cannot submit fraudulent claims successfully. If any claim is fraudulent, or if false statements or devices are used to obtain benefits, all policy benefits and premiums paid will be forfeited. Furthermore, any amounts already paid against fraudulent claims must be repaid to the insurer by the responsible parties."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 132692.67 ms

The context does not specify circumstances under which these expenses would NOT be covered.","Yes, the prosthetic device required for the hip replacement surgery is payable. The walker and lumbar belt used post-discharge are generally not payable unless the lumbar belt was for a lumbar spine surgery.","No, the context does not specify claim admissibility for dependent children above 18 but under 26. However, for dependent children below 18 requiring orthodontic treatment, pre-authorization is mandatory, and the process involves submitting a detailed treatment plan, X-rays, study models, and cost estimates from the dentist before treatment begins.","The policy covers Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. ICU charges are covered up to the category/limit specified in the Policy Schedule/ Certificate of Insurance or actual expenses incurred, whichever is less. The context does not specify a population limit for ICU coverage.","Yes, a newborn child of the employee may be added to the Policy as an Insured Person during the Policy period provided that the application for cover has been accepted, additional premium on pro-rata basis applied on the risk coverage duration for the Insured Person has been received, and an endorsement confirming the addition of such person as an Insured Person has been issued. The insurer may refuse cover if these conditions are not met or if the information provided is inaccurate or incomplete.","The initial daycare cataract claim should be filed immediately after discharge with necessary documents. The subsequent inpatient claim for complications, being in a non-network hospital, requires upfront payment followed by a reimbursement claim submission to the TPA within 15 days of discharge, including original claim form and relevant documents.","Yes, the newborn's treatment expenses are likely eligible for a claim. The policy covers newborn babies from birth if the mother is covered and maternity cover is opted for, subject to limitations of the New Born Baby Benefit Cover and notification within the specified timeframe. The policy also covers medical support services provided to any ICU patient.","No, it is likely insufficient. While a discharge summary from a Clinical Psychologist is relevant (as per Chunk 107), the context specifies the need for a medical practitioner's certificate regarding diagnosis supported by their prescription (Chunk 239), and a general practitioner might not be considered a specialist for mental health claims. The context also mentions specific documents for Critical Illness claims (Chunk 261), which may include additional requirements for mental health conditions.","Yes, ECG electrodes are payable up to 5 electrodes for each OT or ICU visit, with one set payable every second day for longer ICU stays. Sterilized gloves are payable, while unsterilized gloves are not.","Yes, both pre- and post-hospitalization expenses can be claimed. The policy covers pre-hospitalization medical expenses incurred 30 days before hospitalization and post-hospitalization medical expenses incurred for 60 days after discharge, provided they relate to the same illness for which inpatient hospitalization was claimed and accepted.","No, the context does not explicitly state how long a dependent child's coverage continues if they turn 27 during the policy period. However, it does state that children above 18 years will continue to be covered along with parents up to the age of 26 years, provided they are unmarried/unemployed and dependent. It also mentions that a dependent insured person's cover will end when they cease to be a Dependent, unless otherwise agreed specifically for continuation till end of policy period.","Reimbursement for associated medical expenses is proportionate to how the admissible room rate relates to the actual room rate. This applies when the room rate exceeds policy limits, but proportionate deductions are not applied if the hospital doesn't follow differential billing or if expenses aren't differentially billed based on room category. The relevant clause is the Proportionate Clause.","Yes, the company must communicate the grounds for rejection within 15 days of receiving the final documents. If the claim remains rejected and is not subject to a pending suit within twelve months from the date of rejection, it is deemed abandoned. The insured can represent to the company for reconsideration within 15 days of receiving the claim decision.","Yes, the claim is likely eligible. The context defines \"Day Care Treatment\" as medical treatment or surgical procedures undertaken under anesthesia in a hospital/day care center in less than 24 hours due to technological advancement, which would have otherwise required hospitalization of more than 24 hours.","For towns with a population less than 10,00,000, the hospital must have at least 10 in-patient beds, qualified nursing staff round the clock, qualified medical practitioners in charge round the clock, a fully equipped operation theatre, and maintain daily patient records accessible to the insurance company. In all other places (presumably metropolitan areas), the hospital must have at least 15 in-patient beds, along with the other requirements.","Yes, a new employee and their spouse can be added as insured persons during the policy period if the application is accepted, the pro-rata premium is paid, and an endorsement is issued. Siblings can be covered up to the age of 26 if they are unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. The context does not specify the required documentation.","The context mentions coverage for robotic surgeries for other diseases, but not specifically for cancer. It states that expenses incurred on certain procedures, including robotic surgeries, are covered as inpatient or day care treatment, subject to sub-limits indicated in the policy schedule or certificate of insurance.","Yes, for air ambulance evacuation, the insured person must immediately notify the insurer at their call center or in writing, and the evacuation must be pre-authorized by the insurer after determining medical necessity. For claims assessment, air ambulance tickets from a registered service provider are required, and claims for pre and post-hospitalization will be settled on a reimbursement basis upon submission of cash receipts and supporting documents.","Yes, if the insured person has continuous coverage without any breaks, the waiting period for pre-existing diseases or specific illnesses would be reduced to the extent of prior coverage under the previous insurer, as per portability norms. However, waiting periods for listed conditions still apply, even if contracted after the policy starts or were declared and accepted without a specific exclusion.","The context doesn't directly address coverage for imported medications. However, it does state that expenses must be for medically necessary treatment and no more than what other hospitals or doctors in the same locality would charge. This suggests that an imported medication might be covered if deemed medically necessary and the cost is comparable to alternatives.","Yes, in the event of death of an employee, their dependents may continue to be covered until the expiry of the policy period at the option of the insured. The policy will end for a member if he or she dies.","Original invoices with payment receipts and implant stickers are required for all implants used during surgeries. If only a generic invoice without the implant sticker is provided, the claim may be subject to further investigation or denied due to lack of sufficient documentation to verify the implant.","Yes, home nursing charges may qualify for reimbursement if the medical expenses are for the same condition as the hospitalization, the inpatient hospitalization claim is admissible, and domiciliary hospitalization was medically required because the insured person could not be transferred to a hospital or a hospital bed was unavailable. The treating medical practitioner must confirm in writing that domiciliary hospitalization was medically required.","No, in case the available coverage under the primary policy is less than the admissible claim amount, the primary insurer will seek details of other available policies and coordinate with other insurers to settle the balance amount as per policy conditions, provided the insured person submits a written request. The company may accept duly certified documents and claim settlement advice certified by the other insurer if original documents were submitted to them.","No, expenses related to admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded. Also, any diagnostic expenses which are not related or not incidental to the current diagnosis and treatment are excluded.","The context states that any change of nomination must be communicated to the Company in writing and is only effective when an endorsement on the policy is made. In the event of the policyholder's death, the company will pay the nominee named in the policy schedule/certificate/endorsement. If there is no subsisting nominee, payment will be made to the legal heirs or representatives. The context does not address the specific scenario of a nominee's death and a request to update the nomination after that event.","Yes, prostheses or medical appliances are not covered if they are for long-term recuperation, not immediately following surgery, or not deemed medically necessary. The policy also excludes external congenital anomalies or defects, and treatments that are not medically necessary or supported by a prescription.","No, expenses may not be reimbursed. The context mentions that treatments received in unregistered facilities may not be admissible, and expenses incurred in hospitals specifically excluded by the insurer are not admissible, except for stabilization in life-threatening situations. Additionally, mental illness inpatient hospitalization benefits are covered up to the limit mentioned in the schedule.","Yes, the network provider must obtain a fresh authorization letter from the insurer or TPA if there is any change in the diagnosis, treatment plan, or cost of treatment during hospitalization. This ensures that the cashless facility remains valid for the revised treatment.","No, the Pre-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim and Post- Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim shall be processed only after a decision on the main Hospitalisation claim. This means the assessment of pre-hospitalization expenses is contingent upon the approval of the inpatient hospitalization claim.","The context does not directly provide the policyholder's contact details. However, it does provide contact information for the insurance company, United India Insurance Co. Ltd., for grievance redressal, including their website, toll-free number, email, and postal address.","No, automatically approving all claims is not possible. Claim settlement and rejection are explicitly excluded from the services offered by a Third Party Administrator (TPA), and the company may request additional information for claim investigation. All claims are payable in Indian currency only.","Yes, if any claim is fraudulent, involves false statements or declarations, or uses fraudulent means, all benefits under the policy and the premium paid shall be forfeited. Additionally, any amounts already paid against fraudulent claims must be repaid to the insurer by the responsible parties. The insurer may also request additional documents for claim investigation.","No, you are not liable to make any reimbursements of Medical Expenses or pay any other amounts not specified in the Policy. However, reimbursement is available for pre and post-hospitalization expenses, and for hospitalization and daycare expenses if claimed within 15 days of discharge or completion of treatment.","The context lists several medical procedures and conditions that are typically excluded from insurance coverage, including osteoporosis, joint replacement surgery (except when caused by accident), varicose veins, cosmetic or plastic surgery (unless reconstructive), and treatment to change characteristics of the body to those of the opposite sex. It also mentions exclusions for external congenital anomalies, treatments that could be done on an outpatient basis, and alternative treatments.","No, you cannot submit fraudulent claims successfully. If any claim is fraudulent, or if false statements or devices are used to obtain benefits, all policy benefits and premiums paid will be forfeited. Any amounts already paid for fraudulent claims must be repaid to the insurer by those who made the claim."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 129555.75 ms

Additionally, expenses would not be covered if the treatment is not considered a Medically Necessary Treatment or if it involves drugs or treatments not supported by a prescription.","Yes, the prosthetic device required for the hip replacement surgery is payable. The walker and lumbar belt used post-discharge are generally not payable, as per Annexure I \"Non-Medical Expenses,\" unless the lumbar belt was required due to a lumbar spine surgery.","No, the context does not specify coverage for dependents above 18 but under 26. However, for dependent children below 18 years needing orthodontic treatment, pre-authorization is mandatory, requiring a detailed treatment plan, X-rays, study models, and cost estimates from the dentist before treatment begins.","The cost of Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) is covered up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. ICU charges include expenses for the ICU bed, general medical support services, monitoring devices, critical care nursing, and intensivist charges. The context does not specify any limitations based on city population size.","Yes, a newly adopted child can be added as a dependent during the policy period if the application is accepted, the pro-rata premium is paid, and an endorsement confirming the addition is issued. The provided context does not specify circumstances under which the insurer may refuse cover for the child, but material information relevant to risk assessment must be disclosed.","The initial daycare cataract claim should be filed immediately after discharge with necessary documents. The subsequent inpatient claim for complications requires upfront payment, followed by submission of claim documents to the TPA within 15 days of discharge for reimbursement, including a completed claim form and relevant receipts.","Yes, the newborn's treatment expenses are likely eligible for a claim. The policy covers medical treatment expenses traceable to childbirth, including complicated deliveries and caesarean sections. Newborn babies are accepted for cover from birth if the mother is covered and maternity cover is opted, subject to notification and premium payment.","No, it is likely insufficient. While a discharge summary from a Clinical Psychologist is relevant, the context requires a prescription from an \"attending medical practitioner/ surgeon\" for claim reimbursement, and specifies eligible mental health professionals as those with post-graduate degrees in specific fields like Ayurveda, Homoeopathy, Unani, or Siddha, or a Clinical Psychologist, implying a general practitioner's prescription alone may not suffice. The insured person may need to submit additional documents as required by the insurance company.","Yes, ECG electrodes are payable up to 5 electrodes for each OT or ICU visit, with one set payable every second day for longer ICU stays. Sterilized gloves are payable, while unsterilized gloves are not.","Yes, both pre- and post-hospitalization expenses can be claimed. The policy covers pre-hospitalization medical expenses incurred up to a predefined number of days (e.g., 30 days as per clause_4) before hospitalization and post-hospitalization expenses for a predefined number of days (e.g., 60 days as per clause_4) after discharge, provided they relate to the same illness for which inpatient hospitalization was claimed and approved.","The context does not explicitly address the scenario of a dependent child turning 27 during the policy period. However, it states that children above 18 are covered up to 26 if unmarried/unemployed and dependent. It also mentions that a dependent's coverage ends when they cease to be a dependent, unless otherwise agreed for continuation until the end of the policy period.","Reimbursement for associated medical expenses is proportionate to how the admissible room rate relates to the actual room rate. This proportionate deduction does not apply to hospitals without differential billing or expenses where differential billing isn't based on room category, according to the Proportionate Clause.","The company must communicate the grounds for rejection within 15 days of receiving the final documents. If the claim remains rejected and is not subject to a pending suit within twelve months from the date of rejection, it is deemed abandoned. The insured can represent to the company for reconsideration within 15 days of receiving the claim decision.","Yes, the claim is likely eligible. The context defines \"Day Care Treatment\" as medical treatment or surgical procedures undertaken under anesthesia in a hospital/day care center in less than 24 hours due to technological advancement, which would have otherwise required hospitalization of more than 24 hours.","For towns with a population less than 10,00,000, the hospital must have at least 10 in-patient beds, qualified nursing staff round the clock, qualified medical practitioners in charge round the clock, and a fully equipped operation theatre. In all other places (metropolitan areas), the hospital must have at least 15 in-patient beds, along with the other requirements.","Yes, a new employee and their spouse can be added mid-policy if the application is accepted, the pro-rata premium is paid, and an endorsement is issued. Siblings can be covered up to the age of 26 if they are unmarried, unemployed, and dependent. The context does not specify the required documentation.","The context mentions insurance coverage for Robotic Surgeries for other diseases, up to the limit specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period. However, it does not specify coverage details for robotic surgery specifically for cancer, nor does it differentiate between day care procedures and inpatient hospitalization. Therefore, the answer is not found in the context.","Yes, for emergency air ambulance evacuation, the insured person must immediately notify the insurer either at their call center or in writing, and the evacuation must be pre-authorized by the insurer after determining medical necessity. Claims for pre and post-hospitalization, including air ambulance, will be settled on a reimbursement basis upon submission of cash receipts and supporting documents like the air ambulance ticket and a prescription specifying the medical necessity of the treatment.","Yes, if the insured person has continuous coverage without any break as defined under the applicable portability norms, then the waiting period for the specific illness would be reduced to the extent of prior coverage. However, waiting periods for listed conditions still apply even if contracted after the policy starts or were declared and accepted without a specific exclusion.","The context does not explicitly address coverage for imported medications. However, it mentions that expenses must be for \"Medical Expenses means those expenses that an Insured Person has necessarily and actually incurred for medical treatment on account of Illness or Accident on the advice of a Medical Practitioner, as long as these are no more than would have been payable if the Insured Person had not been insured\". This suggests that the medication's necessity and cost compared to alternatives would be considered.","Yes, in the event of death of an employee, their dependents may continue to be covered until the expiry of the policy period at the option of the insured. The policy will end for a member if they die.","Original invoices with payment receipts and implant stickers are required for all implants used during surgeries. If only a generic invoice without an implant sticker is provided, the claim may be subject to further investigation or clarification, and potentially delayed or denied due to a lack of supporting documentation to verify the implant.","Yes, home nursing charges may qualify for reimbursement if the medical expenses are for the same condition as the hospitalization, the inpatient hospitalization claim is admissible, and domiciliary hospitalization was medically required because the insured person could not be transferred to a hospital or a hospital bed was unavailable. The treating medical practitioner must confirm in writing the necessity of domiciliary hospitalization, and additional documents may be required for the reimbursement claim.","No, the primary insurer seeks details of other available policies and coordinates with other insurers to settle the balance amount as per policy conditions, provided the insured person submits a written request. In the event of a claim lodged as per Settlement under multiple policies clause and the original documents having been submitted to the other insurer, the company may accept the duly certified documents and claim settlement advice duly certified by the other insurer subject to satisfaction of the company.","No, expenses related to admission primarily for diagnostics and evaluation purposes only are excluded. Also, any diagnostic expenses which are not related or not incidental to the current diagnosis and treatment are excluded.","The context doesn't directly address the scenario of updating the nominee after the previous nominee's death and without a prior endorsement. However, it states that in the event of the policyholder's death and the absence of a nominee, the company will pay the legal heirs or legal representatives. Therefore, without a valid nominee, the claim would be processed through legal channels.","Yes, prostheses or medical appliances are not covered if they are for long-term use, not immediately following surgery, or not medically necessary. The policy also excludes external congenital anomalies or defects and treatments that are not medically necessary.","No, the expenses may not be reimbursed. Treatment in unregistered facilities or those not complying with specific criteria (like local registration for polyclinics) may not be admissible. Additionally, mental illness coverage may have specific limits as outlined in the policy schedule.","Yes, the network provider must obtain a fresh pre-authorization letter from the TPA if there's a change in diagnosis, treatment plan, or cost of treatment during hospitalization. This process should follow the guidelines outlined in clause V.4.","No, the Pre-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim and Post- Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim shall be processed only after a decision on the main Hospitalisation claim.","The provided context does not contain the policyholder's contact details. However, in case of any grievance, the insured person may contact the company through their website www.uiic.co.in, toll-free number 1800 425 333 33, or email customercare@uiic.co.in. They can also contact the Customer Care Department at United India Insurance Co. Ltd., 24, Whites Road, Chennai, Tamil Nadu- 600014.","No, automatically approving all claims is not possible. Claim settlement and rejection are explicitly excluded from the services offered by a Third Party Administrator (TPA), and additional documentation/information may be required for claim investigation to provide clarity. All claims under the policy shall be payable in Indian currency only.","Yes, if any claim is fraudulent, involves false statements or declarations, or uses fraudulent means, all benefits under the policy and the premium paid shall be forfeited. Any amount already paid against fraudulent claims must be repaid to the insurer by the recipient(s)/policyholder(s). The insurer may also request additional documents or information to investigate a claim.","No, you are not liable to receive reimbursements for medical expenses not specified in the policy. The policy outlines specific conditions and treatments covered, and charges related to a hospital stay not expressly mentioned as covered are typically excluded. Reimbursement is available for hospitalization, daycare, and pre/post-hospitalization expenses, subject to specific time limits for document submission.","The context lists several medical procedures and conditions that are typically excluded from insurance coverage, including osteoporosis, joint replacement surgery (except when caused by accident), varicose veins, cosmetic or plastic surgery (unless reconstructive), and treatments to change the body's characteristics to the opposite sex. It also mentions exclusions for external congenital anomalies, treatments that could be done on an outpatient basis, and alternative treatments.","No, you cannot submit fraudulent claims successfully. If any claim is fraudulent, or if false statements or devices are used to obtain benefits, all policy benefits and premiums paid will be forfeited. Any amounts already paid against fraudulent claims must be repaid to the insurer by those who made the claim."]} | Status Code: 200 | Time: 93229.91 ms
