  "If an accident necessitates air ambulance evacuation with subsequent inpatient admission, what steps must be followed for both pre-authorization and claims assessment? Discuss mandatory requirements and documentation.": "Emergency medical evacuations require pre-authorization, so you'll need to contact the insurer immediately through their call center or in writing. Their specialists, along with the emergency assistance service, will determine if the evacuation or repatriation is medically necessary before approving it.

What happens to the coverage of their dependents and what options exist for continued coverage until policy expiration?": "Yes, in employer-employee group policies, if an employee dies, their dependents can continue to be covered until the policy expires, provided the insured chooses this option.

However, this coordination and settlement, which will be as per the policy conditions, only occurs if the insured person submits a written request.",

The policy also has exclusions for pre-existing diseases, waiting periods for certain conditions, rest cure, rehabilitation, and standard permanent exclusions. Information about specific claim eligibility for negative imaging or other tests is not available in the provided context. The context includes policy details, names, and dates seemingly related to insurance policies, but doesn't relate to the question \"All tests\".",
  "How does the insurer treat requests to update the nominee after the sudden demise of the previous nominee and in the absence of any prior endorsement for nominee change?": "Yes, in the event of the policyholder's death, the company will pay the nominee as named in the policy schedule.

It's important to remember that if there are any changes to the diagnosis, treatment plan, or costs during hospitalization, the network provider must get a new pre-authorization letter from the insurer to keep the cashless facility valid.",
  "If a claim for pre-hospitalization expenses is submitted before the main inpatient hospitalization claim has been approved, how is this processed according to the assessment sequence outlined in the policy?": "The Pre-Hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover claim will only be processed after a decision has been made on your main Hospitalisation claim. The policy is designed to assess claims in a step-by-step manner, meaning the pre-hospitalization claim's outcome relies on the main hospitalization claim's decision.",

  "Can I receive reimbursement for expenses not related to hospitalization?": "No, the policy states that pre- and post-hospitalization medical expenses are covered only if a claim for in-patient hospitalization has been accepted and the expenses are related to the same illness or injury. The company is not liable to make any reimbursements of Medical Expenses or pay any other amounts not specified in the Policy.",
